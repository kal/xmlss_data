A desire to erect a monument to the fallen of World War I emerged in the early 1920s but nothing came of the first effort and in the meantime Bristol's Remembrance Day services were held around a temporary cenotaph approximately two metres high which was erected annually on St. Augustine's Bridge [BUAD 539M] in the Tramway Centre.\r\nA second attempt to create a memorial was made in the mid-1920s by the newly-established Bristol branch of the British Legion. Opinion was divided over whether to create a reverential public monument or to establish a memorial with a more practical function, particularly to support disabled servicemen. A committee was established to campaign for funds and College Green, then occupied by the Replica High Cross [BUAD 40M] was proposed as a site but this was opposed by the Dean and Chapter, who owned College Green. An alternative site in the footway in front of the Church of St. Augustine-the-Less was also rejected. The council did, however, fund construction of a small housing estate at Bethune in northern France at this time as memorial.\r\nA third attempt to create a memorial in the late 1920s proved successful. A site was allocated at the northern end of the Tramway Centre and the council provided £790 to prepare it in July 1931. The design for the memorial was selected by means of an architectural competition. Eighteen submitted designs were reduced to a shortlist of three by G. C. Lawrence FRIBA, an assessor selected by the President of the Royal Insititute of British Architects. The three shortlisted designs, by C. R. Beechcroft, Adrian E. Powell and the practice of H. Heathman and Miss E. Blacker, were published in the Bristol Evening Times and Echo for the public to vote on. The winning design was that by Heathman and Blacker, and this was built during the first half of 1932. The cenotaph was unveiled by Field-Marshal Sir William Birdwood, who commanded the ANZAC forces during the First World War, on Sunday 16th July 1932 at a ceremony involving the council, armed and civilian services, the Bishop of Bristol and representatives of other religious denominations.\r\nThe monument is a tepaering rectangular slab of Portland stone set on a stepped plinth with plain square blocks approximately 1.1 metres high at each corner. The top is moulded in the form of a fascine with scrolled consoles at either end and a sarcophagus on top. At the centre of both the north-east and south-west faces is a large wreath with a central sword. The dates \"1914\" and \"1918\" were carved below the wreath, on either side of the sword. The dates \"1939\" and \"1945\" were subsequently added. Below the dates are bronze plaques with a band of roundels containing service badges, including those of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force, running around the monument at the level of the plaques. The plaque on the north-east face of the monument carries the legend:\r\n\"O VALIANT HEARTS, WHO TO YOUR GLORY CAME\r\nTHROUGH DUST OF CONFLICT AND THROUGH BATTLE-FLAME:\r\nTRANQUIL YOU LIE, YOUR KNIGHTLY VIRTUE PROVED\r\nYOUR MEMORY HALLOWED IN THE LAND YOU LOVED\r\nSPLENDID YOU PASSED, THE GREAT SURRENDER MADE\r\nINTO THE LIGHT THAT NEVERMORE SHALL FADE\r\nALL YOU HAD HOPED FOR, ALL YOU HAD, YOU GAVE\r\nTO SAVE MANKIND, YOUSELVES YOU SCORNED TO SAVE.\"\r\nThe plaque on the south-west face is inscribed:\r\n\"SACRED TO THE MEMORY\r\nOF BRISTOL'S SONS AND\r\nDAUGHTERS WHO MADE\r\nTHE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE\"\r\nThe mention of \"daughters\" is unusual and possibly unique (Dr. C. Moriarty pers. comm.).\r\nOn the narrow, south-east and north-west facing, sides are the arms of the City of Bristol in bronze.\r\nSome 10 metres from each of the square blocks at corners of the plinth there are four bronze openwork lamp standards with globe lamps each with a lion's head roundel on every side.\r\nThe cenotaph has a Grade II listing (Listed Building No. 901-1/11/551). The bronze lamp standards are listed separately (Listed Building No. 901-1/11/552) and are also Grade II. The monument is owned and maintained by Bristol City Council. The stonework is currently [14/06/2001] suffering erosion probably attributable to pollution.
