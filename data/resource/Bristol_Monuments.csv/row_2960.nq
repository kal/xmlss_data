The chapel was built in 1753 for a Methodist society. The building measured 24 metres from east to west and was 15.5 metres wide and was a two-storey structure of rendered stone rubble.\r\nThe main, west-facing, elevation was of three bays. The primary entrance was in the central bay, and was formed by a large arch with a double doorway set within it. Above this was a large, two-light window while close to the head of the gable there was a circular window with an elaborate sill. The fenestration in the two adjacent bays was formed by small segmental arched windows and there were similar lights in the south wall of the building. A circular chimney stack projected from the south side of the roof. The roof itself had a gable at the west end and the rear and was hipped towards the lantern. The side aisles had separate roofs.\r\nThe interior of the building seems to have formed a assembly single space five bays long, which was divided by stone Tuscan columns into nave and aisles. The nave ceiling was coved with a central octagonal lantern and there were galleries around the north, west and south sides. The pulpit was sited against the east wall of the building and had a square base, pedimented back panel and was accessed via two staircases, one on its north and one on its south side (Stell 1986, 63). The organ in the Tabernacle was built by John Smith senior of the Bristol organ builders John Smith and Sons, in 1815 to 1828 (Whaley 1977).\r\nThe crypt of the Tabernacle was a single space apparently extending beneath the entire footprint of the building, with a vaulted roof supported on parallel rows of square columns. A number of brick burial vaults were sited within it the floor and there was also a vault for W. D. Wills (Winstone 1987, pl.54).\r\nThe chapel later became a Congregational chapel. The interior was partly refitted in the nineteenth century.\r\nImmediately to the south of the chapel was the 1834 Sunday school (BUAD 90M), with Whitefield's house (later used as a vestry) behind it.\r\nThe building was demolished to the level of the base of the crypt in the second half of 1958 to make way for the development of Broadmead shopping centre. The Smith organ is reported to have been installed in the United Reform Church , Gloucester Road, Horfield in 1960. In 2006 the site of the Tabernacle was archaeologically excavated by Jon Webster for Cotswold Archaeology, recovering an assemblage of human remains from interments in brick vaults within the crypt."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
