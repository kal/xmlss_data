<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_2131> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "An equestrian statue of King William III as Roman emperor in triumph by the Belgian sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694-1770), located at the centre of Queen Square (BUAD 307M). The statue was commissioned by the Bristol Corporation in 1731, after the buildings around the side of the square had been completed, to form the focal point of a proposed scheme of cross and diagonal gravel paths in the central green space. The commissioning of the statue was facilitated by John Elbridge (founder of a charity school at St. Michael's Hill (BUAD 933M)) and the Corporation ordered a payment of £500 to him on 25 August 1733. The following year the Society of Merchant Venturers paid Elbridge £300 towards the statue (Eustace 1982, 31-32).\r\nRysbrack produced the sculpture in his studio in London. The clay model for the statue was begun on 1 May 1733 (a small gilded model was also produced), and the statue had been cast in plaster by 1 August of that year. The brass casting was also executed in Rysbrack's studio and the statue was brought to Bristol by sea in July 1735. Despite the apparent success of the work, this appears to have been Rysbrack's only work in metal. On 25 September 1736 the mayor Lionel Lyde reported that the statue had been erected in the Square. However, an outstanding balance of £709 10s 3d remained to be paid. The Corporation undertook to pay £500 and the Society of Merchant Venturers contributed another £200 to Lyde \"towards finishing King Williams statue\" (quoted in Eustace 1982, 32-32).\r\nThe statue was set on a large ashlar pedestal of Portland stone with a moulded plinth and cornice and faced north, towards the Custom House. The works to landscape the square and lay out the gravel paths were then implemented (Hughes et al. 1996, 23). By 1749 the statue had apparently started to show faults and the Town Clerk was instructed to write to the sculptor to advise him of this. The Corporation ultimately resolved to carry out works \"to repair the Defects in the s[ai]d statue at the Expence of this House\" (quoted in Hughes et al. 1996, 24). At sometime between the rioting in the square in 1831 and 1880 the statue was enclosed with iron railings.\r\nIn the late 1930s the inner circuit road was pushed through the centre of Queen Square from Redcliffe Way.\r\nAfter restoration work the statue was placed on a small traffic island in the middle of the carriageway facing towards the Centre (Winstone 1987, pls.91-92) and it remained in this position until it was replaced on its original alignment as part of a scheme to restore the square implemented in 1999 (Merritt 2002, 16). The opportunity was taken to make a photogrammetric survey of the statue (BUAD 3498) and carry out conservation work. Samples of the metal were also analysed, which established its composition an alloy of copper and zinc, ie brass (Merritt 200216-17). Observation of the groundworks associated with the reconstruction of the plinth (BUAD 3515) noted a group of numerals carved on its north face. The inscription consisted of a group of three characters \"173\" and another, unfinished, character, apparently a \"4\", suggesting that the plinth may have been pre-fabricated and was assembled in the square (Etheridge 2000).\r\nThe statue has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/220)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
