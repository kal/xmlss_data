The Society of Merchant Venturers was established by an Ordinance of the Bristol Corporation in 1467 and was confirmed by subsequent Royal charters. The site was acquired by the Society in the mid-sixteenth century after the Guild of Mariners which had founded a chantry chapel dedicated to St. Clement (BUAD 1206M) there. The chapel building was converted into use as the Society's meeting hall. A vignette in the border of James Millerd's 1673 plan of Bristol shows the hall in its original form, with the Society's coat of arms fixed to the wall above the main entrance door. The internal plan of the hall during the seventeenth century is not clear, but an inventory of its contents in December 1631 refers to the hall and inner rooms (McGrath 1952, 68-70).\r\nIn 1718 the Society resolved to create new rooms and land on the north side of the existing hall was purchased for an extension. In 1719 a new \"Great Room \" and a \"Withdrawing Room\" were completed. The Society expended a further £1000 in works to the building between 1720 and 1722, including an improved entrance, probably refronting of the King Street elevation and an extension on the north side. The architect Thomas Paty was employed in 1787 to remodel the exterior of the building, a process which seems to have taken a number of years. After Paty's redesign was completed, the building had six bays and two storeys. The lower storey had six casement windows with architrave surrounds. The upper storey had six tall sash windows, with the date \"1701\" between the heads of the third and fourth windows, and the cornice had six sunken panels. The parapet had square corner pillars. The centre of the west elevation steps forward slightly and like the south elevation, had rusticated quoins at the corners. The entrance was at first floor level and was reached by steps with decorative railings. This had a column on either side and a porch, and above the entrance was an arched niche containing a bust on a plinth. A low wall with railings surrounded the precinct. In the nineteenth century a number of internal alterations were made to the building to improve its facilities, including refurnishing in 1838, installation of a heating system - the \"warm air apparatus\" designed by a Mr H. C. Price - in 1842-1843 and a new decorative scheme designed by the architect Owen Jones (McGrath 1975, 269-270).\r\nThe hall was used for entertaining and events by other local organisations and groups on a number of occasions, notably on 10 June 1921 when Edward Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) was made a Freeman of the Society of Merchant Venturers at a ceremony there.\r\nThe building was extensively damaged by bombing on 2 December 1940 and as a result the Society's furniture, plate and records were removed to secure storage. Air raids struck the hall again on 16 March 1941 and then on 14 May (Warne 1943, 20), this time causing irrecoverable damage to the remaining elements of the structure (McGrath 1975, 459-461). It remained derelict for several years after the war while the Society considered whether to rebuild the hall. Finally, in 1955, the site was sold and it was subsequently redeveloped."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
