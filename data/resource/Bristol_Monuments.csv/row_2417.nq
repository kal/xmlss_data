The fort was constructed in 1642 as part of the new northern line of defences around Bristol to protect the city during the English Civil Wars. It was probably built of stone and was apparently square, the Royalist engineer Sir Bernard de Gomme describing it as \"fower square, ech side 24 of my passes\" [probably around 20 metres] (Firth 1925, 184). The structure seems to have consisted of a high level platform with gun embrasures and internal rooms below. A survey of the ordnance captured at the storming of Bristol made on 28 July 1643 records that there were three sakers and one \"murderer\" at the fort (Roy 1975, 261).\r\nIn 1643 fighting around Prior's Hill fort appears to have been relatively limited. There was some exchange of fire on the night of 24 July and the Royalist assault during the following morning included with small attacks on the defensive line to either side of the fort (Firth 1925, 187; 189). The Royalists presumably refortified the structure as part of other strengthening works to the line after their capture of the city but little is currently (17/06/2002) known about the nature of these works although Sprigge's account of the Parliamentarian assault of late-August and early-September 1645 refers to a sally-port near Prior's Hill fort, possibly to the east (Sprigge 1854, 104; 105-106).\r\nThe fort was a focus of fighting during the Parliamentarian assault on Bristol. The fort was subjected to a bombardment on 4 September. During the storming of the city in the early morning of the 10 September the Kingsdown section of the defensive line was heavily assaulted and was entered by the Parliamentarian regiments commanded by Colonel Rainsborough and Colonel Hammond. According to Sprigge Prior's Hill fort \"very obstinately held out, playing fiercely with great and small shot upon our men for two hours after the line was entered\" (Sprigge 1854, 117). The Parliamentarian forces eventually managed to reach the fort and get over the palisades protecting it using ladders. After hand-to-hand fighting they seized the colours and forced the defenders into the inner rooms where, according to Sprigge, \"our soldiers were so little prepared for to show mercy, by the opposition that they met withal in the storm, and the refusal of quarter when it was offered, that they put to the sword the commander, . and almost all the officers, soldiers, and others in the fort, except a very few, which at the entreaty of some our officers, had their lives spared\" (Sprigge 1854, 117).\r\nSprigge reports that following the Parliamentarian capture of the city Cromwell ordered that the forts along the line be left \"in a safe condition\", presumably by partial demolition (Sprigge 1854, 132). The fort had been entirely demolished by the early 1740s and its site is not indicated by Jean Rocque's 1742 map of Bristol which suggests that the area had returned to largely agricultural use by that date. Earthworks associated with the fort survived into the early nineteenth century when the antiquary Samuel Seyer reported that its site was \"discernible from the uneveness of the ground, but its form cannot be traced\" (Seyer 1823, 305). The precise location of the fort has not yet been established but may be beneath the Prior's Hill flats and the houses and gardens of Nos.13-19 Fremantle Road."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
