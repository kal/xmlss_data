The inn occupied the site of two buildings during the Middle Ages. The northern of these was a dwelling first recorded in 1295. An inn called \"le Hart\" had been established there by 1442 and it was then occupied by Martin Whyte. The southern tenement may have been incorporated into the inn by 1438.\r\nThe fifteenth and sixteenth century form of the inn is currently unknown. The buildings appear to have been refronted in the seventeenth century but remained architecturally legible as two structures. The southern building was a four-storey, two-bay jettied house. The ground floor was occupied by a shop front. The jettied first floor was supported by a large pillar at the south end of the frontage and that part of the frontage was recessed to form an entrance porch. The first floor had two bay windows with sash on the south side of the southern of these. There was a two-light large casement in the south face of the building where it projected forward of the next door property. The second floor was also jettied and had a similar arrangement of windows except that the narrow sash window in the south face of the building had only a single light. The third floor was similar although there was no casement in the south face of the building. Full width pentices divided the first and second, and second and third, floors. The roof contained small attic dormers. The northern building was a four-storey, three-bay jettied building. The building had a classical frontage with tall sashes. The jettied first floor overhung the footway and contains twelve over twelve-pane sash windows, while those of the second and third floors had eight over eight-pane sashes. Above each of the first-floor windows there were segmental-arched pediments, while above the second floor sashes there were standard pediments. The eaves of the roof projected well forward of the frontage of the building. The inn sign, a recumbent white hart, was located on the southern house set on a curved support projecting from the centre of the frontage above the ground floor.\r\nSomething of the internal form of the inn was recorded in a probate inventory of 1650. This records ten guest rooms, as well as the parlour, a hall which also contained the \"little Buttery\", the kitchen and a room for the maid (George & George 2002, 166-182). The inn was then leased by George Pearce.\r\nThe Quaker James Naylor stopped at the inn after riding into Bristol on a donkey on Palm Sunday in 1656 (Thomas 1971, 257).\r\nThe building was demolished in the mid-1860s to allow the construction of the Grand Hotel (BUAD 1667M)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
