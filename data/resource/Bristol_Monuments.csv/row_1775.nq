<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_1775> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "Clifton Wood House, located at the junction of Clifton Wood Road and Randall Road. The building is a three-storey house with two bow window bays of nineteenth-century date on the south frontage. The building is currently rendered with limestone dressings and has a pan tile hipped roof with brick ridge stacks. Adjoining the house is a small lawned area to the north and an open yard or driveway extends around the east and south sides of the property. Ruinous structures, possibly a former brewhouse adjoin the house to the northwest. A terraced walk approaches the house from the west alongside the south boundary wall of Goldney House garden.\r\nThe main building has apparently developed in four main phases from the later seventeenth- or early-eighteenth century (Leech, 2003). The earliest structural element of the house survives, though much altered, as the western third of the present house. This earliest structure is likely to have been a \"lodge\" or \"summer house\" (a merchant's second residence) constructed between 1690 and 1710 and measuring approximately 5 metres east-west and 11 metres north-south. This original house was subject to alteration and enlargement, possibly by the Quaker builder George Tully in 1723 (Mowl 1992, 23),  between 1722 and 1728 while in the ownership of Robert Smith to create a double-pile house with three bays. This enlarged building consisted of three storeys with a cellar below the north-east room, with a central hall and stairs extending the full depth of the house on the ground floor. The main stairs as built ascended only to the first floor, there being a separate servants stair (long since removed) to the east of the hall rising from the ground to the first and attic floors. This stair was one of the earliest such features in Bristol, the only other similar example being No.32 Prince Street (a plan of the latter is in the Kingsweston Book of Drawings (R. Leech pers. comm.). On the ground floor there were three reception rooms and a kitchen with projecting scullery wing to the north. There were four chambers on the first floor and five rooms in the attic, probably servants quarters. The ground floor entrance hall and reception rooms and the first floor front chambers were fully panelled with plaster cornices. The wide main stairs to the first floor were provided with marquetry inlays to the newel post, to the panelled wainscot, to the panels to the floor and underside of the upper quarter landing and to the soffit balustrade at the first floor. Most of the doors were of six panels raised and fielded in three heights, the two central panels roughly half the height of those above and below.\r\nIn 1748 the house and estate was sold to Thomas Goldney who leased the property to Selina Countess of Huntingdon, there in 1753 (Leech 2003). From 1757 the property was leased to Richard Farr a merchant and owner of ships engaged in the slave trade, who in 1769 agreed to an increased rent to pay for new work on the house that included a new laundry and enlargement of the brewhouse, possibly one of the outbuildings now ruinous on the site.\r\nIn the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century the house was subject to several alterations and modernisation. New stairs were added from the first to second floor above the entrance hall and the servants' stairs were removed. In the south-east room on the second floor wall cloth placed above a panelled dado replaced earlier plaster and panelled finishes. The dado height panelling in other rooms was possibly fitted at a similar stage. The new stairs from the first to second floors differ from the earlier main stairs, having thinner turned column balusters than the original stairs and a moulded handrail characteristic of the later eighteenth century (Leech 2003). On the ground and first floors the space occupied by the servants' stairs became a closet, the corresponding space on the second floor became a cupboard and the location for new stairs onto the roof. \r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century two bow windows were added to the south-east facing elevation their construction is described by Leech (2003) as 'economical', boarded panels below the windows providing the appearance of solid walls. \r\nIn 1864 the property was sold to Lewis Fry. By the time of the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXV.4.2) surveyed in 1883 the building was in use as a \"Home for crippled children\".\r\nIn 1924 a china pantry, scullery and an external WC were added to the ground floor. On the first floor a new room was added over the new scullery. Plans for these additions indicate that the ground floor south facing window in the south-west angle had been blocked by 1924 to become a cupboard.\r\nTo the west of the house are the ruins of a former necessary house with a stone slab covered earth closet and a former building with a wide fireplace now blocked. This is possibly the former back kitchen or brewhouse constructed in the 1760s. The original roofs of these structures have long since been removed. Further to the west at the end of the long terrace stood a summerhouse, now demolished.  Approximately 7m to the north of the main house an octagonal structure is shown on the plans of 1828 and 1885, possibly a summerhouse, in the area now laid to lawn.\r\nWithin the present garden the main historic feature is the terrace walk, now restored, that approaches the house from the west alongside the boundary wall with the Goldney House gardens to the north. This terrace walk and adjoining boundary walls are likely to date to c.1750 as does the low boundary wall at the west end of the garden. The wall towards the south side of the garden adjoinig Randall Road is not historically a boundary wall, it is the truncated part of a terrace wall within a former orchard shown on the nineteenth century plans. At the east end a wall of the 1880s (with a single door opening towards Randall Road) links this wall to the wall originally separating the inner courtyard in front of the main house from its formal garden (SMR 21731) to the south, separated before 1828 for a new house and garden. A feature of this wall is the projecting rectangular bastion. Since the Randall Road development of the 1880s there has been no boundary wall to the south side of the property. The north boundary wall is built in Brandon Hill Stone laid as random rubble. This wall is shown on the 1828 Ashmead plan and is probably built against the earlier north-south boundary wall against which the original house of 1690-1710 was constructed. The east boundary wall is of unknown date, although it is possibly that shown on the nineteenth century plans.\r\nA stable block (also Grade II listed, Listed Building number 901-1/41/822) associated with Clifton Wood House lies ten metres north of the house. This is a single storey rendred structure with limestone dressings and a pantile hipped roof. The boundary walls and piers of Clifton Wood House are also Grade II listed (Listed Building number 901-1/41/823).\r\nThe building has been surveyed by Dr. Roger Leech of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (SMR 21445). It has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/41/821)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
