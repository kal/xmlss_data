<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_670> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "Bristol Bridge (1247). In 1247 a stone bridge was built across the river Avon between Redcliffe and the High Street/Balwin Street junction to replace an earlier - possibly wooden - bridge. The main structure of the bridge was apparently constructed of Pennant sandstone bonded in a red sandy mortar (BUAD 431; Price in Thomas 1979, 29-33) and had four arches supported by three piers. The central pair of arches, as recorded by a drawing of c.1760 from the downstream side of the bridge (Seyer MS, Bristol Reference Library), were higher and wider than the arches at the northern and southern ends. Buttresses extended the full height of each pier and each pier had a cutwater at either end, that on the upstream side of the central pier extended up river to carry the Chapel of the Assumption (BUAD 667M) which arched over the carriageway. In 1480 William Worcestre measured the bridge and reports that it was 75 yards long by 5 yards wide (Neale 2000, 2-3) and cartographic sources suggest that the abutment extended further towards St. Nicholas Church, on the north bank of the river Avon, than does the present bridge (BUAD 305M).\r\nHouses lined both sides of the central carriageway of the bridge by the later fourteenth century (Veale 1938, 117-118) but the presence of domestic accommodation on the bridge may well date to its construction. The form of the medieval houses is not clear but they appear to have comprised a shop at ground floor with tenements above and William Worcestre gives a dimension of 10 yards for the buildings, presumably the width of the frontage (Neale 2000, 76-77). Some of the buildings were cellared (Veale 1938, 117-118), with the cellars presumably being cut into the piers. Worcestre records that there were five \"very strong\" stone arched cellars on each side of the bridge and a large vault beneath the Chapel of the Assumption. He also notes four cellars at either end of the bridge (Neale 2000, 12-13).\r\nThe evidence for the early-modern housing on the bridge is stronger and these houses were timber-framed, were of four storeys and attic, and many had full-width glazing. Most had gabled roofs, but a few were flat-roofed. The houses projected beyond the sides of the stone bridge, the overhang being supported by props. A vignette in the border of Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol appears to show windows in some of the cellars beneath the houses. The antiquarian Samuel Seyer reports that the form of some of the houses on Bristol Bridge comprised a shop with a small room behind at ground floor, the staircase behind the door. At first floor there was a parlour and usually the kitchen. The second and third floors had two bedchambers each and there were then two garrets above. Some had lead platforms (Seyer 1823, 33-43). The function of these platforms is at present (02/11/2001) unknown but contemporary illustrations suggest that their form is comparable to similar platforms on the roofs of Venetian houses. It is not, however, clear on what authority Seyer's description of the buildings rests. A fire on 17 February 1647 destroyed or damaged 24 of the houses on the bridge (Latimer 1900, 216; Toulmin-Smith 1872, 67) and two years later the Bristol Corporation ordered Walter Stephens, draper, to \"either pull down or repair the arch hanging over the highway leading over the bridge, which is very dangerous to all people travelling that way\" (Latimer 1900, 224). By the eighteenth century the bridge was extremely congested with vehicular traffic and the two outer sides of the bridge sloped towards the middle, adding to the problem (Marcy 1968, 152). When the bridge was replaced in the 1760s the medieval foundations were found to be sound enough to be re-used, and seem to have been encased within the replacement bridge (BUAD 350M). One of the foundations, itself apparently enclosing a timber pile, was noted by William Barrett (BUAD 2590) toward the end of the eighteenth century (Barrett 1789, 77). It is also likely that the remains of the pier bases of the medieval bridge survive in the bed of the Floating Harbour."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
