<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_3607> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "Horfield Barracks, located on the eastern side of modern Filton Road. A field in Horfield named \"West Bartholomew Leaze\" was bought by the War Office in 1843 to construct a new barracks in response to the rioting in Queen Square in 1831 and more generally to a perceived threat to civil order from Chartism (Douet, 1988 112).\r\nThe foundation stone of Horfield barracks was laid on 3 June 1845. Construction was completed and the site brought into commission on 26 April 1847, at a cost of £57000. The barracks occupied a large rectangular parcel of land measuring some 260 metres from north-west to south-east by 170 metres. It was enclosed by a massive exterior wall of sandstone ashlar which, following the design principles of trace italienne, had bastions at the ends and the centre of the southern side. The barracks could accommodate four companies of infantry and two cavalry troops. Internally, the buildings were arranged around a central parade ground and included quarters for the infantry soldiers and cavalry troopers, quarters for officers together with ancillary buildings.\r\nA garrison church (SMR 3209), designed by the architect William Butterfield (who also worked on Horfield Church and designed Highbury Chapel), was constructed immediately to the south.\r\nNew buildings were constructed inside the barracks in 1873 and the field on the opposite side of Filton Road was acquired as a camping area for the Gloucestershire militia.\r\nFrom 1881 until 1940 the barracks was the main training depot for the Gloucestershire Regiment. The Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXII.05) published in 1903 suggests that an infant school for the barracks had been built to the north-west of the garrison church by the end of the nineteenth century.\r\nThe barracks was taken out of use after the Second World War and the barracks was demolished in 1966. Office buildings were constructed within the site and there was some associated reduction of the ground level. Most of the original buildings associated with the barracks appear to have been demolished at this time. However, the barracks wall which surrounded the site is largely extant, particularly in the north-west corner and on the south side of the site where it appeared to be intact. In other locations, particularly on the north side of the barracks, the wall has been significantly reduced in height. Two War Department boundary stones recorded by the Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan survive on the Filton Road frontage.\r\nThe barracks chapel is also extant and has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/53/1411)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
