The history of gas works was assessed by Manco (Manco \"Historical Background\" in Gilmore Hankey Kirke 1995) but this account was superceded by the results of a programme of work on the site by RemedX in 1998. This included a review of the documentary history of the site and full rectified photogrammetric survey of the surviving buildings (BUAD 3339). A watching brief was also undertaken in 1998 during groundworks on the site of the Governor House (Erskine 1998).\r\nSix phases of development were identified the RemedX study (RemedX 1998). During the first phase, from 1824 to 1836, The gas works was created by the Bristol and Clifton Oil Gas Company to produce gas from oil, primarily whale oil. The Plumley and Ashmead's 1828 map of Bristol indicates that the gas works initially occupied only the plot against the east side of Gasferry Road. The production process was housed in a single retort house towards the north end of the site, with a single stone rubble gasholder with a domed roof to the south of this. The upper part of this structure is recorded in a painting of 1837 by W. J. Muller showing Bristol from Clifton Wood (Bristol Museum and Art Gallery K1542). There was also a range of outbuildings. During Phase 2, between 1836 and 1841, the gas works was converted from oil gas to coal gas production when the former became uneconomic. The retort house was modified with new equipment and the range of outbuildings converted into a purifier house. The only surviving fabric from the first two phases of activity is part of the boundary wall along Gasferry Road. During the third phase, 1841 to 1848, the plant was modernised and expanded. Amongst other changes, the site of the ropewalk (BUAD 1282M) on the east side of the gas works was acquired and a larger coal store built there. A new underground Tar and Liquor tank was constructed and new lime purifiers were installed in the purifier house. On the south side of the site, by the north side of Canon's Road, two new gasholders were constructed, as was a landing place for unloading coal was created. In Phase 4, 1848-1860, another acre of land was purchased on the east side of the works and new offices, the main elevation of which is extant in the boundary wall on Canons Road, were constructed overlooking the Floating Harbour. This five-bay building was only a single storey in height. A new gasholder was also built on the newly-acquired land and the Phase 3 coal store converted to a retort house. The Phase 1 gasometer house meanwhile was converted to a purifier house. In 1853 the company was amalgamated with the Bristol Gas Light Company (which operated the Avon Street gas works) to form the Bristol United Gas Company. Phase 5, 1860 to 1870, saw further expansion of the site. The plot on the west side of Gasferry Road was purchased in 1860 and a new purifier house and gasholder erected there. The Phase 1 retort house and gasometer house were demolished along with the Phase 3 gasometers by Canon's Road. The eastern of these was roofed with brick arches to form a new underground liquor tank. Phase 6, 1870-1949, saw the acquisition of more land to the east of the plant. Germaine's timber yard was purchased in 1870 and a second block of land to the east of this probably in the mid- to late-1940s. A new gasholder (No.3) and a new retort house were built, the latter in two phases but completed by 1886. During the twentieth century a carburetted water gas plant, a concentrated liquor plant and a benzole plant were installed. A new jetty for unloading coal from the Floating Harbour was also created. Gas production at the site continued into the post-war period but by 1970 the works were derelict and in 1972 a number of the buildings were demolished.\r\nWhat remains above ground of the buildings of the first three phases of the gas works is represented in the boundary wall of the site. The buildings on the west side of Gasferry Road, the purifier (ST 57903 72530), the No.1 gas holder (ST 57935 72530) and engine house (ST 57937 72498), date to between 1848 and 1860 but the majority of the surviving structures, almost all to the east of Gasferry Road, date to the period after 1870. These include the purifier house and its 1886 extension (ST 57990 72521), the No.3 gasholder towards the east end of the site (ST 58102 72507), the retort house (ST 58072 72440) and coal store (ST 58085 72473) of 1870 and the engine and dynamo house of 1908 (ST 58033 72487).\r\nThe purifier houses, retort house and boundary wall have a Grade II listing (Listed Building numbers 501, 504, 508). The remaining elements of the office building are now considered not to be listable. The ground around the gas works was heavily contaminated and was remediated in 2005."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
