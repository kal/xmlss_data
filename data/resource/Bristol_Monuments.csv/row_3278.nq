The farm was probably established in the mid-seventeenth century. By 1730 it formed part of the estate of the Smyth family of Ashton Court and was rented to James Forest. At that date it comprised 201 acres (BRO BRO AC/M11/32). By the time of the Whitchurch tithe survey of the earlier nineteenth century the farm was owned by Edward Gore Langton and let to Benjamin Hall (Burchill 1997). The Hall family apparently continued to work the farm until the end of the Second World War, buying the freehold in 1924 (Bantock et al 1996, 32; 117).\r\nThe farmhouse was of probable seventeenth century date. It was of two-storeys and attics and measured approximately 14.5 metres from north-west to south-east by 12.5 metres wide. It was constructed of coursed stone rubble  The south-east and north-west facing elevations were gabled and there were freestone copings on each of the gable ends with a ball finial at the apexes of the gables at the south-western end of the building. The roofs were pantiled and there was a chimneystack at the centre of the ridge of the southern range. The northern range had a smaller stack apparently at the centre of the ridge and a single flue chimneystack at the south-eastern end of the north-east facing elevation.\r\nBy the early twentieth century the original windows of the south-east and south-west facing elevations had been replaced with timber casement windows. A one-and-a-half storey extension was added to the north-west facing elevation of the farmhouse and a linked building was attached to its south-east corner. A coursed stone rubble wall enclosed the area on the western side of this building and the southern side of the farmhouse, presumably forming a garden. The farmyard was to the west of this wall and there were a number of outbuildings on the south and west sides of it. Both the extensions and the outbuildings were constructed of stone rubble.\r\nThe farm survived into the twentieth century and is reported to have been extant in 1945 (Bantock et al. 1996, 117). It was purchased by Bristol City Council and the buildings subsequently demolished.\r\nAn archaeological watching brief during development of the site in 1998 (SMR 20460) recorded two limestone rubble walls, both bonded in an off-white lime mortar and 0.43 metres wide, which formed part of one of the outbuildings to the north-west of the farmhouse (Insole 1998). The site of Filwood Farm now lies beneath South Bristol Business Park on the northern side of Hengrove Way."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
