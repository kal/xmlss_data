The plot, with a frontage on Tower Lane, was a garden known as Hasardysgarden which belonged to John Hasard, who lived in Broad Street in the mid-fourteenth century. The house in Broad Street was acquired by Edmund and Isabella Arthur in the later 1380s (Veale 1933, 204) and in 1390 Arthur granted the garden to John Knyghton and William Castell (BRO P/StJB/D/2/75) to be used as the churchyard for St. John the Baptist (BUAD 145M). Parishioners of St. John's had previously been buried in St. James Churchyard.\r\nThe grant included a right of access for the church to reach the churchyard through the gate of the tenement and the entrance to the churchyard remains in Tailor's Court. The use of the plot as a churchyard was confirmed by the Bishop of Worcester on 2nd July 1409 and it was consecrated on 12th June. The right of access appears to have been disputed by the Fraternity of St. John (the Merchant Tailors' Guild) which acquired Hasard's Broad Street tenement. On Sunday 22nd March 1489 members of the Fraternity armed themselves with daggers, swords and clubs to obstruct a procession on the path from Broad Street through Hasard's tenement to St. John's Cemetery, and closed the gates there in the face of the rector, William Thomas and others. The dispute was not resolved until 1499 when arbitrators brought the two sides to agreement. The Fraternity was to allow the parson of St. John to pass without interruption and allow the dead to be brought through the tenement. The parish received an annual rent of 13s. 4d. for Hasard's tenement, and the Fraternity was to retain 12d. of this each year towards the repair of the timber, lock and ironwork of two gates between Broad Street and the cemetery. A set of keys for these gates was to be kept by each party.\r\nThe churchyard measures 28.5 metres from south-west to north-east and is 18 metres wide, and its area has remained essentially the same, with only small changes, since the end of the fourteenth century. Archaeological excavation in 1979 (BUAD 320) recorded a strip containing graves adjacent to the existing south-east boundary of the cemetery, indicating that there was an encroachment on the cemetery during the early post-medieval period. The north-west corner of the churchyard was also removed in the third quarter of the eighteenth century to allow the creation of John Street. The burials do not appear to have been cleared from this area, and in the 1960s a grave was discovered there (BUAD 567). The Pennant sandstone rubble boundary walls and the limestone ashlar gate piers are of eighteenth-century date. Within the churchyard there are a number of post-medieval monuments and gravestones, notably the tomb of Hugh Brown (BUAD 378M) which is of seventeenth-century date and is sited against the south-east boundary wall of the churchyard.\r\nThe burial ground was reported to be full in 1850 with an average of thirteen interments each year (Clark 1850, 158). The churchyard was closed to burials by an Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852.\r\nThe walls, piers, gates and railings of the churchyard are listed Grade II (Listed Building number 901-1/11/680)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
