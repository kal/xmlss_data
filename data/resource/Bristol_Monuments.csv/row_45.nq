<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_45> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "The church of St. Thomas the Martyr, located on the west side of St. Thomas Street. The foundation date of the church is uncertain but the dedication to St. Thomas a Beckett (who was murdered in 1170) implies a foundation date near the end of the twelfth century. The church was a chapel of ease to St. John in Bedminster. The churchyard (BUAD 526M) had been established on the north side of the church by the end of the thirteenth century.\r\nThe original internal plan of the church and its medieval development is poorly understood. Documentary evidence records several chapels within the church including chapels dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St. Nicholas by the late fourteenth century (Wadley 1886, 5; 18), as well as one to St. John the Baptist in the first half of the fifteenth century (Wadley 1886, 134). In 1547 there were four chantry chapels - Chepe's, Welle's, Burton's and Stooke's (Maclean 1883-84, 234-235). Welles Chauntry is known to have been founded the early 1330s under the terms of the will of Richard of Wells and was endowed with two halls, the the adjacent shops and other appurtenances (Scott Holmes 1896, 162-163).\r\nThe church was substantially rebuilt in the fifteenth century, including the tower and in 1543-44 stone reclaimed from the buildings of the Carmelite friary in St. Augustine's Place was used for further repairs (Skeeters 1993, 81). The main evidence for the internal organisation of the medieval and early modern church is James Stewart's 1749 drawing of the interior (BUAD 2748), made prior to the rebuilding. This shows the church consisting of a nave, chancel and two aisles, with a lantern above the fourth bay eastward of the nave, and transepts to either side. A new reredos was constructed in 1716. The west wall of the lantern was decorated with complex blank arcading. At the west end of the nave was an organ, behind a screen of classical design. The nave roof was vaulted, there was a pulpit with tester, and iron gates led to the sanctuary. An organ was built according to a specification by John Harris in 1728-1729. The church appears to have had similar proportions in plan to its replacement.\r\nIn 1789 structural weaknesses were identified and it was decided to rebuild the church. Work began that summer, following a design by James Allen, and had been completed by December 1793 (Ison 1952, 84-88). The fifteenth century tower was retained but much of the medieval detailing seems to have been salvaged for buildings elsewhere in the city. A window from the old church was sold to Mr.Charles Joseph Harford, who installed it in his Pleasure Grounds at Stapleton Grove, Stapleton. The font from the old church was acquired by a Mr. Parrington of the White Lion Inn, St. Thomas Street, but was unfortunately broken on later removal (G. W. Braikenridge notes, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery). The 1716 reredos was retained, however. The organ was repaired by John Smith senior of the Bristol organ builders John Smith and Sons in 1825.\r\nIn the nineteenth century the tower was altered, and later restored. Burial within the church and chancel was ended by an Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852. In 1896 the interior was reworked by the architect Hugh Roumieu Gough (1843-1904).\r\nThe church was declared redundant in 1956 and was vested in the Redundant Churches Fund in 1988. A fire in the 1990s destroyed the Harris organ and it was replaced with the organ from St. Werburgh's Church. Three short sections of pipe from the earlier organ are currently (23/10/2006) stored in a cupboard created in the northern entrance to the gallery from the tower. The tower retains a ring of eight bells, the earliest of which is reported to date to the fifteenth century.\r\nSome parts of the late-medieval church have probably survived beneath the floor (BUAD 226) and within the fabric of the walls (BUAD 3273). When the wall of the south aisle of St. Thomas was replastered in 1881 C. J. Taylor, then the incumbent, noted the discovery of \"the detached shaft of a pillar and a stone fixed by a [illegible] that seemed to be the drain pipe from a piscina\" (BUAD 3273; BRO FCP/St.T/R/1b). Excavation in September 1916 is reported to have revealed the base for a respond, drawn by William Venn Gough, and the original fifteenth-century floor-level, 1.5 metres below the existing floor (BUAD 226; Pritchard 1920, 144)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
