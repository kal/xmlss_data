<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_3358> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "Redland Court, located on the south-western side of Redland Court Road. An existing post-medieval house standng on the site was demolished and a new house was constructed (although some of the panelling was apparently reused in the new house) between 1732 and 1735 to designs by John Strahan for John Cossins, a retired London grocer (Ison 1952, 164). The house is a two-storey ashlar building with a hipped roof and cellar. In plan the building had an entrance hall on the north side with stairwells on either side. The eastern stairwell contains a winder stair while the western has a spiral stair. The hall led into the dining room and this connected on its west side with a parlour and on the east with another dining room (Ison 1952, 164-170). All of the rooms have a marble chimneypiece on the west wall and are panelled. The house appears to have had extensive landscaped grounds to the south-east, including a tree avenue approximately 600 metres long (SMR 21899) running north-west from a rusticated stone arch (SMR 21902) with crenellations at modern Cotham Grove towards the house. The newly-completed house and its grounds were surveyed in 1732, the plan surviving in the plans of the British Library. The arch was drawn by James Stewart in 1746 and was still extant in 1828. In 1747 Thomas Paty was commissioned design two pavilions, linked to the north-east and north-west corners of the house by corridors (Charlton & Milton 1951, 61-62).\r\nJohn Cossins died in 1759 and bequeathed the Redland Court estate to his wife Martha (neé Innys). The couple had no children and at her death Martha left the estate to her brother Jeremy Innys who had been living at Redland Court since 1755. At his death in 1765 it passed to another of the Innys siblings, John Innys, and when he died in 1778 to Jeremy Baker (Martha Cossin's nephew). Baker died in 1798 and the estate was auctioned to pay his debts. Much of the land appears to have been bought by Sir John Smyth who subsequently leased it to Stephen Cave, while Henry Seymour purchased the house for £9200. Seymour's son Henry sold the house to Sir Richard Vaughan in 1811. Vaughan was declared bankrupt in December 1828 and the house was purchased in the following December by James Evan Baillie who initially lived there and continued to own it until his death in 1863. George Oldham bought Redland Court in 1864 and on his death in 1883 the house was acquired by Redland High School for Girls. The school moved into the buildings in 1885 (Little 1983, 4). The associated landscape park was developed for housing in the later-nineteenth century. The school commissioned the architectural practice Oatley and Lawrence to convert the stables to classrooms and refront the building in 1911-1912 (Little 1983, 7).\r\nThere has been little archaeological work at Redland Court but the stairs of the building were surveyed by C. D. Ruding Bryan, probably in the early 1920s (Dening 1923, 80).\r\nThe building has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/35/1719)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
