In his will of December 1753 Alderman William Vick, a Bristol wine merchant, bequeathed £1000 to the Society of Merchant Venturers to pay for a bridge across the Avon Gorge. Little was done for some decades but after pressure for action on the scheme from the Chamber of Commerce the Society formed a committee to oversee the project. By 1829 the funds available from Vick's legacy had reached £8000 and a trust was created in 1830. It was intended to raise the necessary additional money through loans and public donations and £22,007 was raised in this way, the great majority from loans (Portman 2002, 5). The committee obtained an Act of Parliament to allow the building of a toll bridge (11Geo.IV c69) in May 1830.\r\nAn architectural competition, judged by Thomas Telford, was held in 1829 and ended with Telford rejecting all 22 proposals (including one from I. K. Brunel). Consequently in late-1830 a second competition was held, the Trustees having invited Telford to submit his own design. The second competition was judged by Davies Gilbert, past president of the Royal Society who had worked on the Menai Bridge, and John Seaward, an iron founder, and was won by I. K. Brunel (Rolt 1957, 53-55). Brunel submitted four designs for a suspension bridge with detailing ranging from Gothic to Egyptian and employed the local artist Samuel Jackson to produce views of the proposed designs (Greenacre & Stoddard 1986, 48-55). The final design incorporated elements of Brunel's No.2 and No.3 designs combined with the Egyptian detailing which characterised his No.4 design. Gilbert raised a number of concerns based on his experience at Menai and I. K. Brunel and his father Marc Isambard Brunel made alterations to the scheme to take these on board. A shortfall in the available funds meant that the scheme was cut down to a cost of £45,000 and construction was to take four years.\r\nWork began on the Somerset side of the Gorge and on 27 August 1836 the foundation stone for the Leigh Woods abutment was laid but the contractors building the Somerset abutment, Orton & Paxton, went bankrupt in 1837. Construction of the Clifton abutment was started in 1838. The pylons were substantially completed but construction halted in 1840 because funds were exhausted. The chains for the bridge, which had already been manufactured but not completely paid for, were sold on and used on Brunel's Royal Albert Bridge across the river Tamar in 1853 (Buchanan & Cossons 1969, 183).\r\nIn 1859 the engineer John Hawkshaw decided to complete the Clifton bridge. The piers were in sound condition and a new company was formed to which the original Trustees sold the assets in return for £2,000 in shares. The proposal was redesigned to enable the bridge to be built at minimum cost and the chains from Brunel's Hungerford Bridge in London were acquired (Porter Goff 1974). Sir Greville Smyth of Ashton Court supported the scheme but demanded a wider roadway and agreed to provide the £5000 needed. A new Act of Parliament was obtained for the completion of the bridge on 28 June 1861 and as one of its clauses this reserved an element of any operating profits to the Trustees. They would thereby be able to reduce the debt on the bridge by gradually purchasing the shares in the Company, ultimately wind up the trust and operate the bridge as a toll bridge. Construction resumed in November 1862 with Hawkshaw and W. H. Barlow acting as engineers to the project.\r\nThe bridge was opened on 8 December 1864 with a procession through Bristol to the bridge. An artillery salute by guns of the Volunteer Artillery sited in Leigh Woods was followed by an opening ceremony attended by the Directors of the Company, the Lords Lieutenants for Gloucestershire and Somerset, the Mayor of Bristol and the Bishop of Bristol at the bridge itself (Barnes 1928, 35-40).\r\nThe bridge consists of square red sandstone ashlar abutments with Pennant sandstone walls, and squared Pennant sandstone rubble pylons with limestone dressings. The pylons have battered fronts and backs, and are canted half-way up the sides to deep coved cornices. They are pierced by segmental-arched vehicle arches and these have parabolic arches above. The eastern pylon has narrow pointed-arched side openings and is constructed as a series of large arched vaults.\r\nThe Trust completed the purchase of the shares in 1952 and on 1 August 1952 an Act of Parliament was obtained to reincorporate the Trustees and allow the bridge to function as a toll bridge.\r\nClifton Suspension Bridge has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/7/750)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
