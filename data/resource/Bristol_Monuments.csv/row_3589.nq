<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_3589> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "The tomb of Raja Ram Mohun Roy Bahadoor, Arno's Vale Cemetery. Ram Mohum Roy Badahoor was born in Radhanagar, Bengal on 22 May 1772. He worked for the East India Company between 1804 and 1814 and learned Persian and English, which were the official languages of the Company's administrative structure. Roy had a strong interest in religious matters and learned Arabic, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew to further his studies of the fundamental texts of the great world religions. He held strongly to a monotheistic religious viewpoint, arguing against both Hindu worship of gods and goddesses and the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. In 1828 Roy founded the religious movement Brahmo Samaj (the Society of Brahma), the aim of which was to establish the worship of the Supreme Being. He also sought reform of the caste system and an improvement of the social status of women and children. In particular, with William Carey, he helped to persuade the Governor General of India, William Bentinck, to abolish suttee (the practice of burning a widow on her husband's funeral pyre) in 1829. In 1830, Roy became the envoy of the Emperor of Delhi to England. In April 1831 Roy arrived in England, primarily to witness the renewal of the East India Company charter, but he also attended the coronation of William IV. Roy travelled to Bristol in 1833 to visit Dr. Lant Carpenter, the Minister of the Unitarian Chapel at Lewin's Mead and father of the educational reformer Mary Carpenter. He stayed with other members of the Unitarian congregation at Stapleton but developed symptoms of meningitis and died there on 27 September 1833. His remains were initially interred at Stapleton but were moved to Arno's Vale cemetery in 1843.\r\nThe tomb for Ram Muhum Roy at Arno's Vale was commissioned by Dwarkanath Tagore (1794-1846), grandfather of the poet Rabindranath Tagore who had become wealthy through joint business ventures with British traders. It was designed in 1842 by William Prinsep (1794-1874) who had travelled to India as a merchant in 1817 and studied painting there under the artist George Chinnery.\r\nThe tomb is designed as an open temple in a Romantic Indian style with a cruciform plan. It is constructed of Limestone ashlar and comprises a high plinth with twelve decorated columns in groups of three at each corner supporting a flat roof. At the centre of the roof there is a tall, square-based, pointed dome with pinnacles at the top and the corners, and stone leaves on the sides. Within the monument there is a rectangular ashlar limestone block with a carved inscription on its south-east face. The inscription reads:\r\n\"BENEATH THIS STONE REST THE REMAINS OF / RAJA RAMMOHUN ROY BAHADOOR, / A CONSCIENTIOUS AND STEADFAST BELIEVER IN THE UNITY OF THE GODHEAD, / HE CONSECRATED HIS LIFE WITH ENTIRE DEVOTION TO THE WORSHIP OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT ALONE, / TO GREAT NATURAL TALENTS, HE UNITED THROUGH MASTERY OF SEVERAL LANGUAGES / AND EARLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS ONE OF THE GREATEST SCHOLARS OF HIS DAY. / HIS UNWEARIED LABOURS TO PROMOTE THE SOCIAL, MORAL AND PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE / PEOPLE OF INDIA, HIS EARNEST ENDEAVOURS TO SUPPRESS IDOLATRY, AND THE RITE OF SUTTEE / AND HIS CONSTANT ZEALOUS ADVOCACY OF WHATEVER TENDED TO ADVANCE THE GLORY OF / GOD AND THE WELFARE OF MAN LIVE IN THE GREATFUL REMEMBRANCE OF HIS COUNTRYMEN. / THIS TABLET / RECORDS THE SORROW AND PRIDE WITH WHICH HIS MEMORY IS CHERISHED BY HIS DESCENDANTS. / HE WAS BORN AT RADHANAGARE IN BENGAL IN 1774, [sic] / AND DIED AT BRISTOL SEPTEMBER 27TH 1833.\"\r\nA ceremony is held annually on 27 September at the tomb to commemorate Roy's life.\r\nThe tomb has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building No.901-1/47/438)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
