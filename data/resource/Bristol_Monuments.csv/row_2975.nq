<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_2975> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "The Cathedral of the Holy and Undivided Trinity came into being as the centre of the new diocese of Bristol, which was created on 4 June 1542. The old abbey church was taken over as the cathedral and an existing late-medieval building to the south of the Cathedral church was converted into palace (BUAD 789M) for the Bishop. Clergy were accommodated in a number of houses within the precinct of the former abbey.\r\nAt the time of the dissolution Abbot Newland's reconstruction of the nave of the abbey church was unfinished and, the diocese lacking the funds to complete the work, the nave of the cathedral remained truncated until the nineteenth century. Blocking was inserted between the transept walls to form a continuous frontage. The north and south bays of this frontage contained tall arched tracery windows at the extreme ends. The central bay beneath the tower had buttresses which projected west from the frontage. Other alterations were also made to the fabric of the church in the 1540s. The choir screen of the Franciscan friary in Lewin's Mead was purchased and erected in the cathedral. This was later removed. The statutes which established the cathedral required a choir of six minor canons, six lay clerks and six choristers and there was presumably also an organ within the building. By the 1640s the church had an organ by Thomas Dallam, although it is not clear whether this survived the Commonwealth (Spink 1995, 193). However, between 1683 and 1685 the cathedral organist, Thomas Deane, who had been reinstated at the restoration in 1660, was responsible for the installation of a three-manual organ designed by Renatus Harris and constructed by the local organ builder Robert Taunton at a cost of £950 (Spink 1995, 193).\r\nBy the mid-nineteenth century the cathedral was separated from Deanery Road by a low stone wall with iron railings along the top. Works to construct Deanery Road in 1866 also increased access to the north side of the Cathedral by lowering the level of the ground by several feet.\r\nThe nave was reconstructed in the mid nineteenth-century. Designs by G. E. Street were submitted to a public meeting in June 1867. This proposed a nave 117 feet long by 80 feet wide and with twin towers at the west end. The corner stone of the new nave was laid on 17 April 1868 by Lord Limerick, the Provincial Grand Master of the Freemasons \"with grand Masonic ceremony\" according to The Builder (Anon. 1868, 297). The towers of the west end of the new nave were initially roofed above the level of the second stage but the fourth stage was added by the architect John Loughborough Pearson, who designed Truro Cathedral and was also architect to Lincoln Cathedral."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
