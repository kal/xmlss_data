The house was built in the 1760s for Robert Bailey and was originally set in fifteen acres of land. In 1780 Rev. Thomas Ireland, formerly of Langton Lodge, purchased the property and moved there. He sold the estate in 1792 to Charles Hill, and John, Lord Colville of Culros, owned the property until his death in 1810. The house was eventually purchased by George Weare Braikenridge, the merchant and antiquarian, who moved there in 1823. The exterior and interior at the time of Braikenridge's occupation are recorded in a series of drawings by T. L. Rowbotham and other artists which he commissioned (see Stoddard 1981, 27-41).\r\nThe main part of the house was of three storeys with bay windows on either side of the entrance. Both bay windows had three, three-by-four pane sashes at ground and first floor levels and three-by-two pane sashes at second floor. The main door was at the centre of the elevation and was protected by a projecting canopy apparently supported on cast iron columns. At first floor there was a tripartite window with a central three by four pane sash and one by four pane windows on either side. Above this and spanning the full width of the window was a lunette. At second floor level there was another tripartite window with a central three by one pane window and single panes on either side. Above the fenestration a projecting, moulded cornice terminated abruptly on the south-facing elevation of the building. The roof was hipped and there were stacks at the north and south ends and another slightly to the north of the centre of the roof. On the both the north and south sides of the building there were a single-storey extension with pitched roofs. The northern was elaborately decorated by Braikenridge soon after he moved in. He inserted a gothic window with a drip-mould above in the centre of the west facing elevation, a crenellated parapet and a crocketed spirelet at its north end. At the centre of the west facing elevation was a coat of arms, although this had been removed by 1872 (Jones & Chown, 1977 pl.70: SMR 20597). On the apex of the parapet at the north end of the extension was a stone cross supported on a small arch. The decoration of the southern extension is unknown.\r\nBraikenridge was still in residence at the time of the Brislington Tithe Award of 1846 (BRO EP/A/32/9). His son, Reverend George Weare Braikenridge, however put the house on the market in 1867. A sale prospectus describes the house as having ten bedrooms, extensive wine and beer cellars, warm air apparatus and a large courtyard with five-stall stable, coach house, brewhouse, and sheds for livestock (Ireland, 1870: Bristol Record Office: St. LB/HM/1a & 1b). It was bought in 1868 by William Procter Baker, a wealthy corn merchant and Alderman of Bristol. Between 1896 and 1915 George Johnson occupied the property.\r\nThe Brislington Tithe Map indicates that the house was reached by a long drive lined with trees, with its entrance being directly opposite the entrance to Wick House. By 1872 a path ran in front of the west-facing elevation (Jones & Chown 1977, pl.70).\r\nThe house was demolished in 1928 to make way for the development of new housing. Monitoring of subsequent redevelopment of the site in 2004 (SMR 21806) recorded the footprint of the building and the surviving basement which was infilled and left in situ beneath the front gardens of the new buildings."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
