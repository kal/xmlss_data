<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_3160> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "The Chapel of the Assumption also known as the Chapel of St. Mary, located slightly to the north of the centre of the medieval Bristol Bridge. The chapel, a chapel at ease of St Nicholas, was apparently founded using the gifts of several members of the Fraternity of the Assumption of Our Lady (Maclean 1883-84, 239-240) including the burgess Elias Spelly (Neale 2002, 142-143) and lay within the parish of St. Nicholas. William Worcestre gives the dedication date of the chapel as 4th February (Neale 2002, 166-167) and, in addition to funding clerics to perform masses on Saturdays and distributing alms to the poor, revenue from the endowments were to be used to fund the maintenance and repair of Bristol Bridge (Maclean 1883-84, 239-240).\r\nThe chapel was constructed of stone and appears to have been orientated from south-west to north-east across the width of the bridge. There was a large vehicular arch to allow traffic to pass beneath the building. The main description of the structure comes from William Worcestre, who visited it in the early 1480s (BUAD 3601; 3602). He noted that it was 25 yards long and 7 wide (Neale 2000, 2-3) with a square, four-stage stone bell tower \"on the left [in sinistra]\" of the chapel which was reputed to have been built c1460 (Neale 2000, 142-143; 150-151). Worcestre gives the height of the tower as 15 fathoms from ground-level to the bell-chamber \"measured by the bell ropes\" (Neale 2000, 142-143) and the bells were still present in the 1540s (Maclean 1883-84, 239-240). The fenestration comprised four large windows on each side and a \"high\" window above the main altar. One or more of the chapel windows contained stained glass depicting the founders from the Fraternity of the Assumption and their wives (Neale 2000, 142-143). Beneath the building there was a \"beautiful\" large crypt which, Worcestre notes, accommodated the councillors and officers of the town and was used for public meetings about the town's business (Neale, 2000 12-13). Half of the roof was leaded according to the survey made in 1547 (Maclean 1883-84, 239-240).\r\nThe internal organisation of the building is less clear, but in addition to the crypt Worcestre mentions the chapel, a hall with offices and an upper room and highest room (Neale 2002, 166-167) - the latter two presumably being spaces in the tower. There was also a smaller chapel with an altar to the east of the main altar and Worcestre states that this was three yards long (Neale 2000, 166-167).\r\nThe chapel was dissolved in 1547 and was purchased by the Corporation in 1548 for £40 which then rented it out as a warehouse. In 1649 Walter Stephens, draper, was ordered to repair the arch of the former building over the highway which was in a dangerous state (Latimer, 1900 224). The building survived into the mid-eighteenth century, although the tower is not visible in a view of the bridge of c1760 (BUAD 3321) perhaps suggesting that this element had already been removed. The chapel seems to have been demolished in the 1760s, at the same time that the rest of the medieval bridge was removed."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
