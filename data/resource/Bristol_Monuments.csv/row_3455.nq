The building was constructed in 1940 as a Territorial Army Centre for the Gloucestershire Regiment and the building remained largely unaltered after its construction. It is a three-storey brick structure designed in a Neo-Georgian style. The main, south-facing, elevation has a central entrance porch with pilasters topped by a sphinx (the emblem of the Gloucestershire Regiment) extending up to mid second-floor level set on either side. Between the entrance and the first-floor window of the central bay is a plaque bearing the Bristol City arms and the inscription \"DANGER READY\". Between the first and and second floor windows is the date \"1940\". Each of the ground-floor windows is set within a segmental-headed arched opening while the window openings on the upper storeys are flat-headed. On either side of the main block there were two wings and in the space enclosed by the front element of the building and the wings was a two-storey drill hall.\r\nThe Sergeants' Mess and the Junior Ranks' Mess were located at ground floor in the main block, the former on the west side of the entrance lobby and the latter on its east side. The armoury was located in the eastern wing with stores to its north. The ground-floor of the western wing was occupied by offices, including those for the Second-in-Command and Company Sergeant Major. Access to all of the ground-floor rooms in the wings was via the drill hall and at the north end of the drill hall there was a classroom. At first-floor level there was a conference room on the west side of the main stair and the Commanding Officer's office to its east. These offices were served by a corridor at the rear of the building and in the eastern wing there was a three-lane indoor firing range. The western half of the second floor comprised the caretaker's flat while the eastern was accommodation for military personnel.\r\nThe building was redeveloped for housing in 2001 and the majority of the wings and the drill hall were demolished at this tome. However, the main block was retained and the interior converted to apartments. The building was surveyed before this work (SMR 20927: Pilkington, 2001) and several of the original internal features, including fireplaces, remained, radiators and the main staircase were noted to survive from the 1940s. The original iron frame windows were also extant in the side and rear elevations, although they had been replaced with modern replacements in the main elevation. Several of these internal features were, however, removed during the conversion works."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
