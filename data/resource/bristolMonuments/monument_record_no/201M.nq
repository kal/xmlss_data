<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/bristolMonuments/monument_record_no/201M> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "The parish church known as Temple Church or Holy Cross, located on the eastern side of Temple Street. The present church is built on the site of an earlier, circular, church built by the Knights Templar in the twelfth-century. The church was built by the Knights Hospitallers, beginning c.1400 with the nave being completed by 1500. The land to the south and east of the church became the churchyard.\r\nThe church was constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble with Bath stone ashlar dressings and is in a Perpendicular Gothic style. It has an aisled nave (without a clerestorey), and a chancel with five bays containing chapels. At the west end of the south aisle there is a five-stage Somerset-type tower at the south corner of the west end which stands 34.75 metres high. The tower was begun in 1441 and was completed in 1460. Subsidence caused the lower two stages of the tower to lean to the west before the third stage was added. The upper stages were built on an angle to try to correct the structural forces, but the tower then moved again. The pinnacles were consequently never added to the tower.\r\nInternally with chapels of four (smaller) bays to north and south. The chapels included St. Katherine's Chapel, founded by the Weavers' Fraternity in the late-fourteenth century, as well as altars dedicated to the Holy Trinity, SS Andrew and Nicholas and St. James (Wadley 1886, passim). There was also a chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary outside the church (Wadley 1886, 29; 55).\r\nThe Knights Hospitallers were suppressed in 1540 and the church was acquired by the Bristol Corporation in July of that year as part of its purchase of Temple Fee from the Crown (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 626). The chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary was demolished in the sixteenth-century.\r\nA porch with Corinthian pilasters to a segmental pediment with a cartouche inside and an urn on the top was added to the nave in the mid-eighteenth century. The interior was also refitted in the eighteenth-century. In June 1788 the vicar, Rev. Joseph Easterbrook, along with six other ministers, performed a controversial exorcism in the vestry on George Lukins, a tailor from Yatton who claimed to be possessed by demons (Anon., 1788; Easterbrook, 1788). Restoration works were undertaken in 1872, 1907 and 1911.\r\nAn organ was built by Harris in 1701 (although it is not clear whether this was Renatus Harris or John Harris). It was refurbished by John Smith junior of the Bristol organ builders John Smith and Sons in 1847.\r\nThe churchyard was closed to burials in the 1850s and was converted into a public park between 1878 and 1880.\r\nThe church was gutted as a result of bombing on the night of the 24th and 25 November 1940 and only the shell walls now remain.\r\nA survey of the building was undertaken by Wessex Archaeology in 1999 (BUAD 3775; Taylor 2000).\r\nThe church is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (SAM No. AV28841) and is an English Heritage Guardianship Monument. The building has Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/42/337). The archway and gates leading to the church are separately listed Grade II (Listed Building number 901-1/42/336)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
