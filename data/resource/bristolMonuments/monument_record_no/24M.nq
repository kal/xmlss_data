<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/bristolMonuments/monument_record_no/24M> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "No.16 King Street, located on the southern side of King Street. The building was constructed in the mid-1660s apparently as the eastern of a group of three, the lease for the plots of Nos.16-18 being granted by the Bristol Corporation to Francis Bayley, a shipwright, in 1663 (BRO 04335(5) fo.4). This lease set a limit of three years for construction, suggesting that the three buildings had probably been completed by 1666.\r\nThe building is a single-bay, three-storey timber-framed house with a gabled roof. In its original form the plan of the building at ground-floor consisted of two principal rooms which were separated by a half-turn stair placed between them. The stair had square newel posts with ball finials, turned pendants and balusters and a moulded handrail, all of pine. The stair is extant at first-floor level and above. Access to the rear part of the building was through the passage on the eastern side and the architectural evidence suggests that the rear room probably occupied the fill-width of the building. This has a large chimneybreast in the west wall, suggesting that the room was originally the kitchen. The plan of the upper floors was similarly arranged, with two principal rooms, front and rear separated by the stair and landing on the east side and a closet on the west. Both principal rooms occupied the full width of the building. The roof is of principal rafter and butt purlin construction using pine and was originally of five bays.\r\nAt the south end of the plot, fronting on to Little King Street, a warehouse building (BUAD 1437M) was constructed in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth-century. This was of three storeys with hipped pantile roof. The structure was probably linked to the rear of the main house by a gallery at first-floor level.\r\nBy 1676 the house was leased by Thomas Barns of Landavenny, Monmouthshire. In 1703 it was in the hands of Thomas Branch, and had passed to John Aust, hooper, by 1724 (Leech 2001).\r\nThe main house was subject to some internal reorganisation in the early-eighteenth century when the half-turn stair at ground floor level was replaced with a straight stair to allow the two principal ground-floor rooms to be used as a single space. A partition was inserted to extend the side passage to the rear of the building at the same time and a window was inserted in the west wall of the stair at second floor to light the adjacent closet. By 1784 the building had been leased to John Rawson.\r\nThe building appears to have been significantly altered once more in the mid twentieth century, reportedly as the result of bomb damage. The King Street elevation was rebuilt and the northern bay of the roof was replaced with a flat roof during the twentieth century. The rear elevation of the building, including the rear gable of the roof, also seems to have been reconstructed at this time. The walls of the warehouse were re-constructed in brick at this time, although three seventeenth-century cross beams at ground floor and the central cross beam at first-floor were retained, as was the roof the timber of which are of late seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century date.\r\nThe building was surveyed by Dr. Roger Leech in 2001 (BUAD 3812; Leech 2001) and the report on this work also summarised the documentary history of the building. The original core of the main building appears to survive largely intact and several mid seventeenth-century features survive within the building, including the joists and boards of the cellar and a samson post located towards King Street, ovolo-moulded cross beams and doorcases at all floors, as well as several surviving elements of moulded plaster cornices. Much of the fabric of the roof also dates to the original construction of the house.\r\nThe house has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/601)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
