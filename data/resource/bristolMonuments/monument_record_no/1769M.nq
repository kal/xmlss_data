The cave is believed to have been formed by hydrothermal action in a buried Carboniferous limestone ridge around 160 million years ago and a fault or bedding plane controlled the upward flow of water from the cave. It is currently (07/12/2006) the only known fossil hydrothermal cave in the United Kingdom. The main cave is approximately 100 metres long and 60 metres deep and has extensive deposits of the mineral calcite (Calcium carbonate) on the cave walls. There is also a series of galleries to the south-east of the main chamber, also part of the hydrothermal system which formed the cave, which were identified in the eighteenth century. Their precise location and extent is now unknown.\r\nThe cave is reported to have been discovered in 1669 by lead miners (Southwell 1683), apparently working a possible small quarry which appears to lie immediately north-east of the current entrance to the cave. On 2nd July 1669 Captain Samuel Sturmy (1633-1669) made a descent by rope into the cave. Sturmy was a local mariner who lived in St. George. When he retired from the sea he became a customs officer at the Port of Bristol. After leaving this post Sturmy made a series of observations of the tides in the Severn which were communicated to the Royal Society, produced a plan of Bristol (which is now lost), and published the Mariner's Mirror (1669). Sturmy is reported to have caught a chill after his exploration of the cave and died as a result (Southwell 1683; Kenney 1947). Several individuals and groups have subsequently explored the cave and several measured surveys have been made, including one by Captain Greenville Collins in 1682, one by William White in 1775-1776 [this survey is in the collections of Bristol Reference Library B10158], and another by the University of Bristol Spelaeological Society (UBSS) in 1992 (SMR 20138). An extensive investigation was undertaken by the Cave Research Group of Great Britain in 1962 (SMR 24512; Tratman 1963). Geophysical surveys to establish the extent of the cave took place in 2006, including a Ground Penetrating Radar survey (SMR 5087; Thomas 2006) and a radio location survey (SMR 24511).\r\nHistorically the cave has frequently been misinterpreted as a lead mine and there are signs of prospection within it. A proposal to work it was made in 1843, although this does not seem to have been executed. The evidence for prospection probably relates to this episode (Mullan 1993).\r\nPen Park Hole was sealed in 1962 following the Cave Research Group Survey. It was reopened in 1992 for the survey by the University of Bristol Spelaeological Society (UBSS) survey and a permanent, lockable entrance was created at that time.\r\nThe cave is owned by Bristol City Council. Access is administered by UBSS, the Bristol Exploration Club and the Wessex Caving Club."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
