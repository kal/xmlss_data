The churchyard was the burial ground for the parish of St. James and was in use from the medieval period until the 1850s. It also served several other parishes during its lifetime, including St. John until the late fifteenth-century. The churchyard was located on the south side of the parish church, (the nave of the priory church). It was bounded on the north by the priory (although it extended in front of part of the west end of the church, aligned with the original south-west corner, slightly to the north of what is now the western part of St. James Parade) and on the east by a street known as St. James Churchyard (whose line survives as the passage along the east end of the John Lewis department store). The southern boundary was the Horsefair, and the western approximately Lower Maudlin Street. Excavation at the west front of St. James's Church in 1994-1995 (BUAD 3156) found that the northern edge of the churchyard had been moved southward, probably when the south aisle was added (perhaps c.1374), and houses (Nos.14-18) built on the site. The churchyard was not enclosed until 1813.\r\nThe internal arrangement of the churchyard is less well understood. William Worcestre describes a small, square freestone chapel in the churchyard. A path, shown on Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol, ran diagonally across the churchyard. The inhumations in the churchyard have been shown by archaeological excavation in three locations to have been laid in north-south rows with individual burials orientated east-west. No brick burial shafts or vaults have been recorded in the churchyard to date (14/11/98).\r\nThe churchyard was the site of the annual St. James Fair (illustrated by Miss Bird in 1825 (BRSMG Mb2)). The churchyard was subdivided to create a Hay and Coal Market in the south-east part in 1838 and part of the south-western corner was removed for street improvements during the century.\r\nBy the 1850s was found to be full and was closed to burials by an Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852. In 1880 the parochial authorities converted the churchyard into a public park and laid it out with seats, shrubberies and winding paths, which are shown by the Ordnance Survey 1:500 maps of the early 1880s. The surviving two parts of the churchyard are still in use as a public park, the easternmost containing the remains of a calvary cross (BUAD 94M). \r\nThe boundary walls, railings, piers and gates are listed Grade II (No.955), with the walls, gates and railings around the small area of churchyard to the north of the Parade listed Grade II (No.954). The churchyard and the area around the church of St. James have been designated as a conservation area."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
