<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/bristolMonuments/monument_record_no/356M> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "The Lamb Inn, No.50 Wine Street, located on the southern side of Wine Street roughly opposite the junction with Pithay. The Lamb Inn had been established on the site by 1586 (BRO 00347(5)) and was then or lately in the tenure of John Austine, saddler. In 1626 the foeffees of the Whitson Lands granted a lease to John Bradway with a convenant to allow rebuilding. In 1670 the inn was held by Thomas Biggs and probate inventories made at the time of his death in 1677 and his wife's death in 1687 record the rooms and their contents. The inventory for Biggs mentions fifteen rooms for accommodation, kitchen and buttery, and brewhouse (George & George 2005, 80-85). Ten years later the arrangement of the rooms was essentially the same, with additionally a cellar, stables and turret recorded (George & George 2005, 156-160). In 1698 the inn was leased to Onesiphorous Tyndall with the requirement to spend £200 on the building. In 1700 two stables and the rooms over them were purchased from Bradway by Tyndall (Leech 1997, 197).\r\nWhen it was drawn in 1823 (BRSMG M2357; M2358), the building was a gabled, jettied house of three storeys and attic with a three-window range. It was of probable seventeenth-century date, and the façade presumably dated mainly to the rebuilding by Tyndall. The ground floor was largely occupied by a shopfront with a central entrance and windows on its east and west sides. At the west end of the façade at ground floor there was a gabled porch with carving below gable covering an entrance with fretwork gates. At first-floor level there was a wide canted bay with ten lights, and one light to each end. The jettied second floor was supported by a bracket at its eastern end. The fenestration comprised three six by six pane sash windows. The gable end was hung with slates or tiles and at the centre there was a six-light transomed window under a drip-moulding. The gabled roof was pantiled. Evidence for the interior of the building comes from a drawing made by Hugh O'Neill in 1823 during demolition of the building. The eastern wall of the building is all that remains and this is supported by long timber props. Seventeenth-century, or earlier, fireplaces are recorded in the western wall of the building (towards its northern end) at ground-, first- and second-floor levels. A number of doors and sections of panelling are shown propped against the wall.\r\nThe porch is likely to have led to the stables and rooms to the rear of the main building. Latterly it appears to have served a building at the rear, probably No.51 Wine Street. In notes accompanying a painting by O'Neill made before demolition (BRSMG M2357) G. W. Braikenridge records that \"under the Porch late the Warehouse of Messrs. Holland Jackson & Schimmelpenning Dry Salters was formerly the Lamb Inn .... & the House has from the arrangement of the Rooms all the appearance of having been built for an Inn\" (Notes, B7). The warehouse was listed at No.51 Wine Street in the 1819 Bristol directory."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
