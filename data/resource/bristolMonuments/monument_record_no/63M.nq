The New Gaol was designed by Henry Hake Seward who was selected as the architect after an architectural competition (BRO Clerk of the Peace Deposited Plans). Construction of the gaol began in 1816 and it opened in 1820. The original plan of the gaol was recorded by Plumley and Ashmead's 1828 plan of Bristol and consisted of a gatehouse on Cumberland Road with the main elliptical area of the prison enclosed by attached stone walls to its north. The entrance gateway stood on Cumberland Road on the south side of the prison at the mid-point of the high perimeter wall. The gateway had drum towers on either corner and to the north of this, across the yard, was the Governor's House. This had five bays and three storeys and there was a large arched gateway in the centre of the ground floor on the south front. The cell blocks radiated from the Governor's House to the east, west, north-east and north-west and were connected to it by walkways at third-floor level. The cell blocks on the east and west sides each had fourteen bays and three storeys. Chimney stacks projected from the hipped roofs of both of these blocks. The water supply was drawn from a well by a treadmill pump and distributed to cisterns around the prison by a system of pipes but the well became contaminated with water from the Floating Harbour in the summer months, blocking the pipes and requiring that drinking water be bought in. The plan form of the New Gaol suggests that Seward was influenced by Bentham's panopticon principle. Certainly, management of the prison conformed to the emphases on surveillance and separation which characterised early- to mid-Victorian penal theory.\r\nDuring the Bristol riots of 1831 the prison was attacked by the rioters. The prisoners were released and the buildings, including the Governor's house were burned. The gaol was subsequently rebuilt by R. S. Pope but how extensive Pope's rebuilding of the gaol was, and how far it altered Seward's original design, has yet to be defined. The separate system was introduced into the prison at the beginning of the 1840s (Wood et al. n.d.) and it influenced subsequent alterations to the building, including the creation of stalls within the chapel to ensure prisoners could only view the chaplain (see Winston 1965 pl.70). Overcrowding had also become a problem at the gaol by the 1840s and the day rooms were converted into ten extra cells. By the 1860s the chapel was located between the two cell blocks to the west of the Governor's House. The treadmill was sited in a building adjacent to the north-eastern cell block. Another round of alterations was proposed in 1869.\r\nThe New Gaol was closed in 1883. The site was purchased by the Great Western Railway Company in 1895 and the majority of the structure was demolished in 1898 to allow development of Wapping Wharf but the gateway and parts of the perimeter wall are still extant. These have a Grade II listing (Listed Building numbers 901-1/42/1295 (Entrance gate) and 901-1/42/1296 (Perimeter wall)). The National Monuments Record has a file on the New Gaol (NMR File No. 90988)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
