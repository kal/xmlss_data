<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/bristolMonuments/monument_record_no/2750M> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "National Filling Factory No.23, also known as H.M. Factory Chittening, located on the western side of Chittening Road. The factory was established by the Ministry of Munitions in October 1917 to manufacture the blister agent mustard gas (sulphur mustard - 1,1-thiobis(2-chloroethane)) in response to German use of the weapon in the early stages of the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele) and Nobel's Explosives were instructed to construct a plant at the site to manufacture thiodiglycol, a mustard gas precursor, in December 1917. Progress with construction of the factory appears to have been slow and site clearance was still in progress when a strike stopped work throughout most of March 1918 (Haber 1986, 164). Construction of the mustard gas facility was abandoned in April 1918 and production moved to a new factory at Avonmouth (SMR 21403; located on the south side of Kingsweston Lane) which was constructed in May and June (National Archives MUN 4/1696; Haber 1986, 165; Hartcup 1988, 109). The Chittening factory was re-equipped for filling artillery shells and began to operate on 8 July 1918. Initially part of the site was given over to production of chloropicrin, a vomiting and lachrymatory agent in its own right, which is commonly mixed with mustard gas to raise its freezing point and hence its battlefield dispersal (Sidell et al 1997, 201). Later in July the plant started to produce mustard gas shells. However, manufacturing problems at the Avonmouth factory meant that the site worked at well below its capacity until September (Haber 1986, 191). The filling of mustard gas shells at the plant was extremely hazardous and 1213 gas injuries were reported at Chittening between 21 June and 7 December 1918 (Haber 1986, 249). To counter the extremely high sickness and absenteeism rates which resulted, the hours of work were reduced and an entitlement to a week's holiday for every 20 days worked introduced (Haber 1986, 251-252). However, the Treasury was still agreeing compensation payments for injured workers in 1920 (National Archives T 1/12456).\r\nAccording to a plan dated 27 November 1918 (National Archives MUN 4/1753) the factory was served by a platform on the railway line to the south-west of the site and a road led to what may have been be a pair of gatehouses with time clocks a short distance to the west. There was a large canteen building to the south-west and the dirty change house and clean change house (both with associated detached lavatories) to the north-west. The site itself was arranged on a grid pattern. Isolated on the north-west side was the laboratory with stores, the engine shop, repair shop, laundry and boiler house to the south-east. The railway ran from the north past these buildings and south of the canteen to pass north-east around the core of the site. Inside the railway were large receiving sheds with small charging sheds on their south-east side. A small hospital building stood in isolation at the centre of the site and to the south-east of this were the assembly sheds. To the south-east again, adjacent to the railway line, were the dispatching sheds and box store. Army Ordnance Department (A.O.D.) and other store buildings and magazines stood between Greensplot Farm (SMR 9230) and Washingpool Farm (SMR 9232) to the east of the site. The general offices, a larger hospital, inspection offices and a garage lay away from the main site, to the south of Greensplot Farm.\r\nIt is not currently clear what area of the site was used specifically for the production of mustard gas and how much for other munitions. The postwar use of the site is unknown but all of the factory buildings appear to have remained standing into the 1930s (SMR 21401; Neale 1976, 227) and most were still extant at the end of the Second World War. Two brick air raid shelters were constructed on the southern side of the dirty change house, probably in the late 1930s.  The group of structures close to Chittening Warth had been demolished by the beginning of December 1946 (CPE/UK/1869 Frame 4015; SMR 21402) with the exception of the laundry buildings and the chimney of the boiler house. The general offices and surrounding buildings, including the hospital, and most of the A.O.D. stores were also extant.\r\nAn archaeological desk-based assessment of the site of the changing sheds was carried out in 2004 (SMR 21992; Bryant 2004) and the surviving historic buildings in the core of the filling factory, including the dirty and clean change houses, a dispatch shed and an assembly shed were subsequently archaeologically recorded  in advance of their demolition (SMR 22114; Davis 2004).\r\nThere are photographs of buildings within the factory in the SMR Collection of Ground-based photographs."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
