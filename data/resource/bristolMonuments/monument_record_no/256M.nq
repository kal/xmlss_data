<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/bristolMonuments/monument_record_no/256M> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "The New Room, located on the southern side of The Horsefair. The building was the first Methodist chapel to be built.\r\nGeorge Whitefield (1714-1770), a recently-ordained Anglican minister who began to evangelise in Bristol in early 1739, had quickly established two meetings of followers based at St. Nicholas Street and Baldwin Street. The New Room was established to support these two groups and the foundation stone of the building was laid on 12 May 1739 (Stell 1986, 68).\r\nThe building is a two-storey structure with rendered stone walls, a basement and hipped, pantile roofs. The original entrance to the building was at the north-east corner via a narrow alley, later known as Wesley Court, from Horsefair (Stell 1986, 68). Internally, the ground floor is occupied by the meeting-room which has a roughly rectangular, though irregular, plan measuring approximately 19.3 metres from north to south by 12.9 metres wide. There are galleries on the east and west sides and the pulpit, which has two desks and is enclosed by mahogany rails, stands against the north wall. The seating at ground-level is believed to have consisted of movable wooden benches. A clock (of c.1670 which had been purchased by his father, Samuel, in 1710) was donated by John Wesley and is fixed to the gallery rail of the west gallery. The first floor is supported by six Tuscan columns, forming aisles on either side of the meeting room and the room is lit by a large semi-circular arched windows and in the north and south walls, and other smaller windows together with an octagonal lantern which passes through the first floor rooms. The sides of the lantern contain windows to provide light to those rooms. The largest room on the upper floor is the Conference Room, approximately 9.2 metres long, with the lantern located towards the northern end. There is a row of four rooms on each side of the Conference Room which were used by preachers. John Wesley had the two rooms at the south-west corner, usually visiting the New Room three times each year, while other preachers used the remainder.\r\nIn April 1739 Whitefield, planning his second trip to the American colonies, invited John Wesley to Bristol to take over responsibility for the Bristol awakening in his absence. There was a strong theological disagreement between the two men over predestination and election, Whitefield adopting a Calvinistic position while Wesley was inclined towards Arminianism. On his arrival Wesley preached in defence of free will and thereby began to create a split amongst Bristol's Methodists. Despite this Whitefield nevertheless persisted with his intention of entrusting affairs to Wesley and sailed for the Americas in August 1739. Local Calvinist Methodists appealed to the Welsh evangelist Howel Harris (1714-1739) to defend their position. Wesley assured Harris that his views were compatible with those of Whitefield. However, in June 1740 Wesley expelled the advocates of predestination and took control of the New Room and the Kingswood school (Jones 2003, 80-82).\r\nThe New Room was altered in 1748. An extension was added to the south end and a new main entrance was created off Broadmead. A single-storey lean-to structure, the Preachers Stable was constructed on the east side of the entrance. It is not currently (26/05/2006) known whether the courtyard to the south of the building was created as part of this work or whether it already existed, although a stone screen separating it from Broadmead was probably built at this time. This was of squared, coursed Lias stone with limestone ashlar dressings and at the centre was an elliptical arch with wrought-iron gates and an urn finial above. The original entrance appears to have been blocked off and a small vestry, the Conference Room, created in the north-east corner of the meeting-room. A small square limestone ashlar panel at first-floor level on the east side of the north elevation of the building which celebrates its foundation John Wesley in 1739 may also have been fixed at this time.\r\nIn 1792 the Portland Chapel (BUAD 257M) was opened in Portland Street, Cotham to serve the growing number of Methodists living on the north side of the city and reduced the numbers attending services in the New Room. Two years later the New Room congregation split over the question of ordination as a requirement for the administration of commmunion and a new chapel, the Ebenezer Chapel (BUAD 258M) was established on the western side of Old King Street by those who left the meeting. This further weakened the New Room and in 1808 it was sold to Welsh Calvinistic Methodists.\r\nThe Welsh Methodist congregation retained the building until the late 1920s, adding wooden pews. In 1929 the building was purchased by Edmund Sykes Lamplough (1860-1940), deputy-chairman of Lloyd's of London, who then gave it to the Methodist Conference. The building was restored under the supervision of the architect Sir George Oatley. Oatley designed new wooden pews and an organ made by John Snetzler of London in 1761 was purchased in c.1929 from Little Plumstead Church in Norfolk. After refurbishment the organ was installed in the gallery in 1930. An equestrian statue of John Wesley was erected in the Broadmead courtyard on the south side of the building in c.1932 (BUAD 1668M). In 1939 a statue of Charles Wesley (BUAD 1669M) was placed in The Horsefair courtyard on its north side.\r\nThe remains of Captain Thomas Webb (c.1720-1796), influential in the establishment of Methodism in North America, and his wife were reinterred in the Broadmead coutyard to the south of the building when the Portland Chapel was closed in 1972.\r\nInvestigation of the building has been limited. It was surveyed by A. Barbara Coates of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (RCHME) in 1944 (BUAD 956; Stell 1986, 66-68) and was re-examined by Christopher Stell of RCHME in the 1980s (Stell 1986, 66-68).\r\nThe building has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/40/481). The screen wall on the Broadmead frontage is listed Grade II (Listed Building number 901-1/40/477). The statues of John Wesley (Listed Building number 901-1/40/480) and Samuel Wesley (Listed Building number 901-1/40/484) are also listed Grade II."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
