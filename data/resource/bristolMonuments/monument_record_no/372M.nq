<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/bristolMonuments/monument_record_no/372M> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "The Green Lattice, No.41 High Street, located on the south-western side of High Street. The site is known to have been bequeathed by Alice Hailes to All Saints' Church in 1261. The feoffees borrowed money to build an inn or tavern known as the \"Grene Lates\" between 1439 and 1442 and the building was still known as the Green Lattice in 1653 (Leech, 1997). The tavern was one of the row of houses at the northern end of High Street known during the medieval period as Cooks Row, which sold take-away food to those without the means to cook for themselves. Entries in the accounts of the churchwardens of All Saints for 1475 and 1488 record construction work to the building, particularly to the kitchen (Burgess, 2000 84-85; 120). The form of the medieval building has not been completely established but it consisted of a cellared single-bay house with a detached kitchen separated by an open yard to the rear. Part of the medieval arch windbrace roof of the kitchen (drawn by George Pryce in 1850 (BUAD 3044; Pryce, 1850)) survives, as do two cellars of medieval date beneath the site. The roof of the front, east, cellar is of 5 inch square joists supported on 11 inch square transverse oak joists. The rear, west, cellar has a vaulted stone roof, with an original opening lined with freestone blocks. The walls of the cellar are of coursed rubble bonded in a red mortar with lime inclusions. In the south-west corner is a shute again lined with freestone blocks which, it was thought, might have been part of a garderobe for the floor above (Leech, 1999).\r\nThe facade of the house was replaced in the seventeenth century and this was painted by Hugh O'Neill in 1823 (BUAD 1419: Braikenridge Collection, BRSMG M2387). The view shows that the new front was jettied and the roof was gabled. There were shop windows either side of central entrance, a light above the doorway and cellar access under the south window. The glazing at first-floor was full-width and included a central bay with an Ipswich window. There was a roofed oriel or bay at second-floor, with 16/24 pane sash to the front and 6/9 to the side. The four-light attic window had no transom. The bargeboards had carved decoration. George Weare Braikenridge notes that in 1823 the building was known as The Sign of the Three Blackbirds, although a Mr. Stockdale and his son had carried on their woollen drapery business there for many years and it was then occupied by John, Joseph and Benjamin Davies, woollen warehouse.\r\nIn June 1825 the building was again re-fronted, the new facade being of limestone ashlar in a late-Georgian Greek Revival style having been taken to afford access to the Rummer Tavern in All Saints Lane (Braikenridge Notes, C.30). The building is of two storeys and attic with a two-window range and a hipped mansard roof. The shop front dates to the twentieth century and has right-hand doorway and plate-glass window.\r\nNo.41 High Street was surveyed by Dr. Roger Leech and the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England in 1997 (BUAD 3413) when a plan of the cellars of the building and a cross-section of the rear part of the building and the medieval roof were made (Leech, 1999). The party walls are of stone rubble and may also contain medieval fabric and features. Medieval and early modern timberwork could also remain within the floors of the building. The roof at the rear of the property is a unique survival of a medieval domestic roof in Bristol\r\n[Photographs of the interior of the building, including the medieval roof, are held in the Sites and Monuments Record collection of ground-based photographs, Nos.646-676]"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
