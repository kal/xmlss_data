<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/bristolMonuments/monument_record_no/107M> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "The Cyder House, located 43 metres north-east of Broad Street. The building was constructed in the twelfth-century and was house with first floor hall. It was orientated from north-west to south-east (parallel to Broad Street) and the footprint of the building measured 13.3 metres from north-west to south-east and it was 7.1 metres wide. The building was constructed of Brandon Hill Grit and the walls were 1 metre thick at foundation level.\r\n\r\nAt lower level there was a V-shaped window embrasure in the end wall.\r\n\r\nThe foundations and end walls were constructed of Brandon Hill Grit, and exceeded 1 metre in thickness.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the south-west side wall had been rebuilt later in the medieval period.\r\n\r\nA view of the exterior from the north-east was drawn by O'Neill in 1820 (BRSMG M2375) shows Cyder House Passage running below the first-floor hall, with, above the passage, a 2-light window with cinquefoil heads under an overall square head with drip moulding, the bottom of the window blocked off. To the north of the passage, against the north-west end of the Norman building, lay a later structure, perhaps of seventeenth-century date. It comprised 2 storeys and attic, 1 gable to each external elevation, its north-west end built against the rear of the Court House in Tailors Court. Both elevations jettied. Entrance, with porch, in north-east wall at first-floor, cross-window to left of it 3-light window in gable; small window to attic storey at right-hand end. South-east elevation not clearly illustrated, but probably with first-floor cross-window, and 3-light window to gable. Structure leading to porch not drawn in detail, but arch shown below it. Some detail of the rear and end of Court House.\r\n\r\nRecorded internally by Rowbotham in 1828, with a view apparently towards the north-western end of the first-floor room or hall. This was open to the roof, one of at least 4, or possibly 5, bays; arch-braced trusses springing off corbels about two-thirds of the way up the side wall, the two corbels visible decorated with faces. Two tiers of plain windbraces; long, moulded, purlin or similar, above uppermost tier. Between 2nd. & 3rd. bays from south, as drawn, a partition to wall plate height, with a full-width carved beam above doorway height; 2 adjacent doorways, left to stairs down, right to stairs up. In first bay of north-east wall, window of at least 2 lights, cinquefoil heads, bottom of lights blocked. in next bay, a small square window above corbels. Floorboards running along length of building; to left, bottom of staircase with twisted newels at bottom.\r\n\r\nLater, the building was in use as a tavern. It appears to have been the Lord Raglan tavern, gutted by fire in the early hours of Tuesday 4 January 1859. The Bristol Mercury newspaper for 8 January 1859 reported \"At about a quarter past three o'clock on Tuesday morning a fire was discovered to have broken out in the Lord Raglan tavern, Cider-house passage, Broad-street.\" and that \"The building being very old, and composed for the most part of wood, the fire spread with rapidity, and the part of the house used as a singing-room, and known as the Lord Raglan Concert-hall, together with the brew-house underneath, was soon wrapped in flames...\" Such concert halls or rooms were the forerunners of the music hall.\r\n\r\nThe south-east gable end remained intact, as did part of the south-west wall until 1990. The house was demolished in early 1990. The north-west gable end survives incorporated into the rear wall of the late-seventeenth century Court House, and was drawn in about 1992. The V-shaped window embrasure at lower level has survived."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
