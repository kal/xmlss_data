<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/bristolMonuments/monument_record_no/274M> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "Canynges House, (also known as Canynges Chapel), located on the western side of Redcliff Street. The building was a substantial house belonging to the merchant William Canynges (1402-1474). It stood on a plot of land approximately 70 metres in length between Redcliff Street and the River Avon which was first developed in the twelfth century (Jones 1986, 7-8). It is not clear how much of the house was built for Canynges in the mid-fifteenth century and how much was an existing building.\r\nThe form of the house as a whole is uncertain but at the east end, close to Redcliff Street, there was a hall with cusped arch-brace roof trusses supported on carved corbels (although \"Many of the Corbels in the Chapel were purchased by the late Mr. Birtill of Mr. Steele the Mason in St. Thomas Street & came originally from the Old Church of St. Thomas Bristol\" (Braikenridge notes)). This part of the building was constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble and was 0.58 metres thick. At the west end of the wall were two blind segmental-headed arches with freestone mouldings. The western arch was 5 metres wide, while the eastern was narrower, spanning 3.60 metres and contained an ogee-headed piscina or stoup (BUAD 999A; BRSMG M2045). The hall had panelling to head height and galleries at first-floor level along the south and east sides. Mr. Lazarus Birtill discovered a fresco on the west wall after he had purchased the building in the early-nineteenth century, and this was retouched in 1805 by a Mr.Young, one of Birtill's relations. A small gothic doorway led into a room, possibly a parlour, on the west side of the hall. This had a floor of encaustic or slip over stamp tiles of probable mid-fifteenth century date.\r\nAbove the hall there was a tower described by William Worcestre, writing in 1480, as measuring 60 feet (18.4 metres) by 48 feet (14.7 metres) with four highly decorated bay windows. Worcestre also indicates that the internal decoration was rich (Neale 2000, 214-215) and the roof of the hall is known to have had a painted and gilded decorative scheme. The house also contained a private chapel after 1454 (Sherbourne 1985, 15).\r\nCanynge's House appears to have been subdivided into three properties in the post-medieval period. The hall appears had carved benches fixed to the south and west walls in the second half of the seventeenth century. The building was considerably altered in the 1820s. The hall was \"dismantled\" in 1821-1822, when the altarpiece in the chapel was removed, and converted to a warehouse which was occupied in 1822 by Mr. Thomas Chamberlain, a brush- and mop-maker. In 1826 the property was owned by Richard Badham of the Champion of Wales public house on Broad Quay, and in the tenure of William Naish, straw bonnet maker as recorded by Sun Fire Insurance Policy 1046624. The policy also records that bleaching was carried out within the property (BUAD 1146).\r\nThe medieval roof of the hall survived until 1937, when the front of the building was removed for road widening. The pavement of medieval tiles was removed to the British Museum. The medieval arches in the north wall survive in situ as part of the freestanding boundary wall of Nos.1-6 Guild Court, Redcliff Backs. Recording of the surviving medieval elements of the building began in the 1820s when several watercolour drawings of the interior were made. Part of the medieval roof of the hall was drawn by Dollman in the 1850s (Dollman & Jobbins 1863) and the main body of the hall was photographed c1910 (Winstone 1957, pl.105) and by Philip Street in 1933 (BUAD 2346-2349). The site of the house was archaeologically excavated in 1983-85 (BUAD 447; Jones 1986) and the standing north wall of the ground-floor hall was recorded by Roger Pryce in 1972 (BUAD 667) and by R. H. Jones in 1985 (BUAD 668)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
