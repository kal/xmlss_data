Factory, Avonmouth, located on the eastern side of St. Andrew's Road. The factory seems initially to have been established to manufacture the high explosive picric acid. In October 1917 a factory, National Filling Factory No.23 (SMR 21403), had been opened at Chittening to manufacture the blister agent mustard gas (sulphur mustard - 1,1-thiobis(2-chloroethane)) in response to German use of the weapon in the early stages of the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele). Work ceased at Chittening in April 1918 and production was moved to the Avonmouth factory which was converted and extended between May and early June 1918, using equipment originally made for Chittening.\r\nInitially the factory used the Guthrie high temperature process and the first batch was produced on 15 June. By the end of June 3.5 tonnes of the gas had been manufactured but this production yield was too low. French scientists were approached for advice and recommended adoption of the Levinstein low temperature method. The reaction temperature was reduced to 40 degrees Centigrade in the first half of July and this resulted in improved yields. However, the ethylene unit required complete overhaul in the second half of the month and this resulted in the shutting down of the entire plant. The first acceptable batch of the chemical was produced on 15 August 1918 (Haber 1986, 165-166; Hartcup 1988, 109) but production levels remained low until September 1918.\r\nThe factory was operational for around six months and had a workforce of 1100. An existing short section of railway was brought into passenger use and the St. Andrew's Road station (SMR 5042) was opened in May 1917 to bring workers to the site. The dangers inherent with the handling of the chemical coupled with the use of porous materials, such as wood and brick, in the construction of the plant led to a high rate of injury amongst the workforce. This was exacerbated by the fact that the factory was still under construction when manufacture began, resulting in \"trying conditions for the workers\" (Anon. 1919, 81). Between 15 June and 15 December 1400 gas casualties were recorded at the Avonmouth factory (Haber 1986, 249) including three fatalities. Around 700 workers were affected, \"some of whom had three or four attacks,\" and the sickness resulting included \"blisters on every part of the body (except the palms of the hands), conjunctivitis, bronchitis, etc., and chronic effects of debility, cough, gastric pain and breathlessness\" (Anon. 1919, 81). The Avonmouth factory ceased production at 8:00pm on 11 November 1918. In all, the factory produced 560 tons of mustard gas, and 416 tons of this were deemed acceptable for shell filling (Haber 1986, 166).\r\nThe layout of the factory is currently uncertain but most of the original factory buildings appear to have been demolished. However, the administration building of the factory is extant. This is a two-storey brick structure with ashlar quoins. The building is orientated north south and has an H-shaped plan. The main element of the building has a central porch with a single doorway with ashlar detailing, including a pediment. It has a hipped roof with tall square projecting brick chimneystacks. There are a number of other surviving structures, including sheds, which may have been associated with the factory. There are also known to have been several reactors and the site was served by an internal electric railway. Three of the battery-powered locomotives were acquired by the Hythe Pier Railway (one being used for spares) where they still operate."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
