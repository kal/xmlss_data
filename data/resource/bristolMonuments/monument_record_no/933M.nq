The girls' school was founded by John Elbridge, and he had apparently overseen the construction of a house and schoolroom, with an associated garden, before his death in February 1739. In his will he left £3,000 in trust \"for the better establishment\" of the school (Manchee 1831, 225-226). Elbridge leased the land parcel within which the school was constructed, Joachim's Close, from the Dean and Chapter of Bristol Cathedral until his death, and the land was presumably part of the endowment he bequeathed for the purpose of founding the school (Leech 2000, 47).\r\nThe school had certainly been constructed by 1747 when it was recorded in a drawing by James Stewart (BUAD 2766). The building was orientated from north-east to south-west, parallel with Fort Lane, and measured approximately 56 feet (17.1 metres) along the Fort Lane frontage by 15 feet (4.6 metres) wide. It was a single-storey six-bay building with a hipped roof. The fenestration of the south-east facing elevation comprised six large sashes and the side, south-west facing, elevation had a single sash at its centre. A low parapet surrounded the roof. The garden was to the north of the building. In the early-nineteenth century the school was described as consisting of \"a dwelling, with several convenient apartments, now occupied by the mistress of the school, with a school-room adjoining, though not under the same roof, and is capable of accommodating one hundred children\" (Manchee 1831, 226). It was managed by the vicar of St. Michael's and the 24 girls educated were taught \"reading, writing, summing, and plain needle-work, and they are otherwise employed so as to fit them for the business of servants. They are also instructed in the elements of christian [sic] duty and belief\" (Manchee 1831, 226).\r\nThe use of the building as a school continued through the nineteenth century and between 1816 and 1830 around £70 was spent on repairs to the building (Manchee 1831, 226). By the time of the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXI.16.14) surveyed in 1881-82 an extension had been added to the northern half of the north-east end of the building. The building was extant at the time of the Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan published in 1903 (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXI.16). However by the time of the third edition plan published in 1918 it had been demolished.\r\nRoyal Fort Road was subsequently widened and the site of the school now lies partly beneath the northern side of the road and partly within the site of the Children's Hospital."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
