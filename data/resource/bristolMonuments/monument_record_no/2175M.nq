<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/bristolMonuments/monument_record_no/2175M> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "Madam Farm. The farm is recorded by the 1772 Southwell estate plan (BRO 26570) where it is named as Watson Farm, but the date of its creation is unknown. The farm lies somewhat askew to Lawrence Weston Road, suggesting that it may predate the laying out of this road. Desk-based assessment suggested that the farm name derives from the adjacent common meadows of Madam or Mead Hamm (Lawler, 1995 6) underwent many structural changes during its lifetime but nonetheless represented a rare survival of what would probably have been a typical farmhouse in the area.\r\nThe building consisted of two long ranges in a double-pile plan with a further range at right angles towards the rear (North) end of the property. An external inspection of the building showed that the western long range of the building was a later addition. It has a flatter roof pitch and its roof abutted that of the range at the rear. It was, however, probably no later than the late eighteenth century. The rear range was constructed of lias limestone, in marked contrast to the western long range and most of the eastern long range. It would appear, therefore, to have been of a separate build from the rest of the property, although it is uncertain whether it was earlier or later in date than the eastern long range. The eastern long range had been partially rendered, but there were traces of similar lias limestone in the upper courses of the east wall near the eaves, perhaps suggesting that the roof had been replaced at some time in the past. At the northern end of the property was a single storey range which necessitated the bricking up of the original fireplace in the north wall of the earlier building. The bricks used were handmade and probably no later than the mid nineteenth century, suggesting that the extension was built some time in the first half of the nineteenth century.\r\nInternal inspection revealed a long through passage extending the full width of the building through both of the long ranges. In the room to the north of the passage in the eastern long range, there was a plain chamfered ceiling beam with a plain stop and a small cupboard in the east wall with H hinges. There was a similar plain chamfered beam in the room opposite, to the south of the through passage. A door leading to the rear range from the through passage had strap hinges with spearhead ends, while a door on the upper floor had strap hinges with expanded ends. The internal fittings are likely to be original to the building and would suggest an initial date for construction in the late seventeenth or possibly the early eighteenth. The building displayed a conservatism of style which might be expected in an isolated area such as the North Avon Levels.\r\nMadam Farm was inspected by the City Archaeologist for Bristol City Council, Bob Jones on 10th May 1997. The inspection was brief and no measured survey was carried out, although some photographs were taken showing the exterior and interior of the farm and its outbuildings which are held in the SMR collection of ground-based photographs. The farm was demolished in May 1998 without record."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
