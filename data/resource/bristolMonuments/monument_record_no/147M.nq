<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/bristolMonuments/monument_record_no/147M> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "The church of St. Nicholas, sited on the line of the earliest town wall, and part of the early medieval Town Wall is visible at the western end of the crowde. The date at which the church was founded is unknown as is the original form. It was in existence by the twelfth century. Early eighteenth-century illustrations exist of the church and gate, suggesting a fourteenth-century date. Much of the fine largely fourteenth-century crowde, or lower church (973A) survives. It has two aisles and four bays with tierceron vaulting and good animate and foliate bosses; at the east end of the south aisle is an arched panel with good figure stops and a hexafoil panel. There is evidence of a former fifth bay at the west end of the southern aisle. The remains of an earlier vault survive east of the northern aisle. Beyond is a small vaulted area, used as a charnel house (970A), with two charnel pits (971A), one at each end. Four phases of construction in the crowde - east end of north aisle, running into the charnel house; eastern two full bays of same; western two ditto; the south aisle. In the south wall is the matrix for a 16th. or 17th.century memorial brass. Beyond the south-east corner are the remains of a staircase that linked with the chancel above. John Attwood, Junior, churchwarden, created a vault for burial use in the void between the old and new south walls at the eastern end. He restored the original crypt entrance, there (now the bottom of the fire exit stairs) in 1822. In 1821 a stone coffin was found partly embedded in the north wall (1032A).\r\nThe mid 14th.century church was demolished in 1762. The church was completely rebuilt above the lower church or crypt 1769 by James Bridges, the steeple and interior being designed by Thomas Paty. Bridges' design, building off the old crypt, was an early and remarkably well-studied attempt at Gothic revival, and the windows have similarities with those of St. Peter's, Peter Street (qv). The interior had a very fine Rococo plaster ceiling by Thomas Stocking. The chancel of the medieval church lay above St. Nicholas Gate, being a number of steps above the nave level. The location of the present tower was formerly a public thoroughfare between St. Nicholas and Baldwin Streets.\r\nBath stone ashlar and Pennant rubble.\r\nNave and west tower. Georgian Gothic Revival style.\r\nWindowless east end projecting to the centre; below a moulded string are rubble crypt walls with quatrefoil openings. 7-bay north elevation (matched on the south), a re-set 15th.century three-light mullion window in the east bay and an inserted 20th.century door to the west of that; tall 5-light Perpendicular windows separated by buttresses up to a blind arcaded parapet. \r\nThe crypt, or crowde, wall, extended outwards in the 18th.century, is exposed on the south side through the falling ground, and has a gabled porch in the second bay from the west; parapeted vestry (now stairs connecting the two levels) in the south-westcorner has a 4-light south window. \r\n2-stage tower: the north door has an ogee hood, with 20th.century glazing and small entrance lobby; above is an 8-foil oculus; the belfry has paired windows with ogee hoods, the bottom half blind, the top louvred, and clasping pilaster buttresses, open arcaded parapet, with pinnacles; on the south face is a clock, with a rare second hand (Arch.El.No.972A). Octagonal 3-stage spire with oculi around the middle stage.\r\nIn crypt a 18th.century baluster-shaped font. A 16th.century wall memorial (John Whitson) with a panelled base, flanking buttresses with pinnacles, an arch over with panelled soffit and an effigy on one elbow (Arch.El.No.974A), at one time in the porch below the tower.\r\nBurial in the crypt was ended by an Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852.\r\nBombing during the Second World War destroyed the eighteenth-century upper church. The interior was largely rebuilt and the pre-war double gabled roof was replaced by a flat roof. The brass eagle lectern of c1480, William Edney's gates, and the sword rest have all been removed to St. Stephen's Church (qv). The 1822 Whitson monument, sited below the tower, was badly damaged in the Blitz, but portions survive. The church was declared redundant and used as a museum from 1973 until 1993."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
