A minster is thought to have stood on the site by the early eighth century. In c963AD a Benedictine monastery was established at the site by Oswald (Bishop of Worcester, 961-992). He appointed a monk named Germanus from the abbey of Fleury at Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire (where Oswald had spent a period earlier in his career) as prior and Westbury became a focus of a Benedictine revival in the region (Graham 1907, 107). In 968-970 the monastery was suppressed and the monks transferred to the Ramsey abbey in northern Cambridgeshire. The monastery was refounded by Bishop Wulfstan (1062-1096) as a cell of Worcester in about 1086. In 1093 it was endowed with lands in Westbury itself, Henbury, Charlton and elsewhere in Gloucesterhshire. The monastery was again suppressed, this time by Bishop Samson (1096-1113) and a college of secular canons was established. In 1286 this was enlarged from five to fourteen canonries by Bishop Giffard (1286-1301) in an attempt to have the churches within his patronage made prebendal to Westbury (Hoskin 2003, 439). Westbury College was reconstituted by Bishop Carpenter (1443-1476) with a grammar school and almshouse. The grammar school was founded in 1463 and the master was funded through the revenues of the Clifton parish church, St. Andrew. The first master was Roger Fabell and along with all of the subsequent masters he held the post together with another benefice. Carpenter also funded exhibitions for six scholars at Oriel College, Oxford and the dean of had the right to nominate at least one exhibitioner (Orme 1976, 182-184). Edward IV granted a number of manors and other privileges to Westbury in the 1460s (Graham 1907, 108). In 1535 the college comprised the Dean, the Sub-Dean, five prebendaries, Bishop Carpenter's chaplain, eight fellows, four clerks, six aged priests, twelve choristers and a schoolmaster (Graham 1907, 108).\r\nThe College was surrendered to the Crown in February 1544, the surrender document being signed by the Dean, John Barlo[w], the Sub-Dean John Lawrence and John Kerell and Thomas Barlo[w], prebendaries (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 65). This also resulted in the loss of the grammar school. The College site and its property holdings were purchased by Sir Ralph Sadleir in March 1544 (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 175-176).\r\nDuring the Royalist attack on Bristol in July 1643 Prince Rupert was quartered at the College (Firth 1925, 183) and it was apparently one of the buildings fired by Royalist troops as the New Model Army arrived to attack Bristol in 1645. The College building was drawn by James Stewart in September 1747.\r\nArchaeological excavation in 1968 directed by M. W. Ponsford of Bristol City Museum, revealed a boundary wall and stone jetty adjoining the River Trym, interpreted as a possible part of the college of 1194. Also recorded were buildings dating from the thirteenth- to the fifteenth-centuries with an L-shaped moat around the site. The oldest surviving elements of the Westbury College building include a four-storey gate tower and corner turrets, a spiral stair leading to the bell chamber.\r\nThe building has a Grade I listing (Listed Building Number 901-1/26/2056)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
