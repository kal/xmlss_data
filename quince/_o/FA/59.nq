The skeletons were buried in shallow graves, with heads to the west. In a number of cases the right arm was laid across the chest, with the left arm extended. No grave goods were recovered, but black pottery was found in the graves for Inhumations I, III and IIIi. It was inferred that the occupants of the graves were Christians buried between 400 and 700AD (Godman 1972)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
