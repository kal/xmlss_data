The building appears to have been constructed at the north edge of the interior of the Fransiscan friary and was probably therefore constructed after the Dissolution, either in the second half of the sixteenth or the seventeenth century. Its footprint measured 10.9 metres from east to west and 6 metres north-south. The building was of one (possibly two) storeys plus attic. The north-west facing elevation of was of rendered rubble.\r\nThe north-west corner of the building was cut back at ground-floor, and corbelled out above. The building had a pitched pantile roof and a gable covering a projecting tower, possibly a stair tower. This had a small square single light in its gable end and a similar square window in the main body of the wall to the west. There was a gable at the south-west end, and another, facing north-west, at the north-east end.\r\nThe building was in use as a store for Butcher & Co., builders, of Rupert Street in the 1930s. It was probably demolished in early 1973. Its site lies mainly to the west of the Whitefriars office block beneath an access road and landscaping."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
