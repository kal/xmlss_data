The store was built in 1918 to serve National Filling Factory No.23 and is recorded by a plan in the National Archives (MUN 4/1753) dated 27 November 1918. The building measured approximately 32 metres from north to south and was 26 metres wide with a double-pile plan.\r\nThe shell of the western half of the building was extant in 1946 but had lost its roof. The eastern half had been demolished by that date. The remainder of the structure was subsequently demolished."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
