The sculpture was commissioned by Copthall Holdings as part of the development of York House. It was designed by the artist Paul Mount (1922-) who had trained at the Royal College of Art and worked in Lagos between 1955 and 1962. The sculpture was fabricated between 1968 and 1969 in his studio at Nancherrow, St. Just-in-Penwith near Penzance in Cornwall with the assistance of the local blacksmith, Jim Williams. No brief was given, only a plan of the site, and the finished work cost £6000. The sculpture is a stainless steel structure with a mild steel armature set on a large rectangular area of landscaping of black engineering bricks. The design comprises six triangular aerodynamic forms with straight and parabolic edges linked together. Mount said that the design was \"derived from a combination of sail shapes and equestrian forms.\" A scale model was tested in a wind tunnel by Professor Joseph Black of the School of Engineering, University of Bath. Black had performed the wind tunnel tests on Concorde and Mount was guided on the finishing of the metal surfaces by Amos Underhill of Coventry who had polished the prototype turbine blades for the Concorde engines.\r\nMount erected the sculpture on the site in the summer of 1971 with the assistance from Christine Feiler. There was no unveiling ceremony."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
