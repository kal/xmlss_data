Almost certainly a merchant's cellar, being, at the front, not dissimilar to that at the present No.35 Corn Street (BUAD 109M). Beneath the east corner of Corn Street and St. Nicholas Street, largely beneath the National Westminster Bank but partly under the western end of the latter street. In May 1827 lay below Lucas's china shop. \r\nThe front portion consisted of a cellar of parallelogram plan with three Y-plan ribs, the top each Y towards Corn Street. In the north wall, at the apex of the eastern Y, was an opening from that street. In the opposite wall were three openings into the, larger, rear portion, each with segmental-arches. The limbs of the second Y met at a decorative boss. Beyond the west end was a rectangular extension.  The floor of the front cellar was raised almost to the springing by 1827. \r\nThe rear cellar was much more plain, was twice the area of the front part, and the same width as it. There were shallow recesses in the east and west walls, also the north wall of the front cellar."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
