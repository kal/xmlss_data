The land between the lane on the east side of the Old Library (BUAD 14M) and St. Nicholas Almshouses (BUAD 17M) was leased to Thomas Wickham, carpenter, by the Corporation in 1650 on condition that he built six messuages within ten years. No.34 King Street seems to have been constructed as a warehouse for No.33 King Street (BUAD 111M) and its footprint extended originally some 4.6 metres north from the street frontage. The warehouse was presumably part of the property associated with No.33 King Street until the later nineteenth century. No.33 King Street had been constructed by 1658. In 1673 the buildings on Wickham's plot were leased to Robert Dowding, ropemaker. No.33, and \"a sellar adjoining\", was at that time occupied by Robert Cary, grocer. A new lease was issued to John Freke, gentleman, in 1688 and the house was apparently then in the possession of Jacob Beel, merchant (BRO 04335(7) fo.82). By 1700 it was occupied by John Templeman, mariner. Freke's lease reverted to the Corporation in 1716 and in the following year it was leased to Thomas Seed, hooper. From 1739 Seed leased the property on a yearly basis and occupied it himself.\r\nBy January 1887 a building had been constructed at the rear of the plot, leaving an open courtyard between this building and the warehouse on the street frontage. This courtyard was not developed before the later 1950s. Leech noted that plans of the building made in 1985 recorded a chimney stack against the north wall of the site, although this is now the location of a lift (Leech 1997).\r\nThe ground floor of the building was surveyed by John Bryant in 1986 (BUAD 375). A full survey was made by Dr. Roger Leech of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England in 1993 (BUAD 2045; Leech 1997).\r\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/608). There is a photograph of the exterior of the building in the SMR Collection of Ground-based photographs, No.1341."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
