A house stood on the site by the early 1670s. The site had been acquired by Richard Going, a Bristol pewterer, by 1729 and he had presumably demolished the earlier house by that date since the site was described as void in the ratebooks for that year. St. Michael's Hill House was constructed for Going and was \"in building\" in 1732 (Leech 2001, 17). Dening suggests that it may have been designed by John Strahan (Dening 1923, 113).\r\nThe building was a three-storey house of brick with a hipped roof with a square lantern. Internally the main stair was located to one side of the entrance hall and was 3 feet 6 inches [1.07 metres] wide and, according to Dening, had \"carved spandrel brackets with Doric columns as balusters, every third column being twisted\" (Dening 1923, 114). It did not continue above the first floor. There was a large walled garden to the rear of the house.\r\nThe house was occupied by Charles Biggs in 1739 and 1740 but was once more in the hands of Going by 1749. In 1765-1766 the site was leased by Valentine Watkins but was occupied by William Nicholls by 1770 and Thomas Whitehead by 1773. Between 1883 and the beginning of the nineteenth century the house became a military training establishment where the 6th Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment was based. The garden became a drill ground.\r\nThe house was severely damaged by bombing in 1940-41 (Warne 1943, 21). It was subsequently demolished and the site redeveloped for the St. Michael's Maternity Hospital."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

The building is the southernmost of a terrace of nineteen houses. The plot, formerly part of the grounds associated with Clifton Hill House, was leased from the Society of Merchant Venturers by Harry Elderton in 1792 for a term of forty years (Ison 1952, 234). Construction of the terrace began under the supervision of William Paty (Priest 2003, 101) but was abandoned in 1793 when the outbreak of war caused a slump in development. The buildings remained uncompleted for nearly two decades but the terrace had apparently been completed by 1815.\r\nThe building is a rendered three-storey house with attic and basement. It has a slate mansard roof. A raised walk on the east side of the building extends the full length of the terrace. A two-storey porch with a semi-circular arched front ground-floor window and cornices at ground and first floor level, was added to the entrance doorway in the late nineteenth century.\r\nIn 1882 the building was occupied by Rev. A. H. Ward.\r\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/41/6)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
