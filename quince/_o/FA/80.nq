The house was a two-storey structure measuring 4 metres by 2.7 metres wide and was attached to a similar building on its north-west side. It is not clear when the house was constructed but it may be associated with the occupation of No.8 Charles Street by Daniel Sidnell in the mid-1770s, Sidnell Court being one of the earlier names for Seville Court. The building was in existence by 1828 and survived until at least 1957, but was subsequently demolished."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
