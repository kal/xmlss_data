The decision in 1890 to erect a fixed bridge meant that the upper part of the Floating Harbour between Stone Bridge and the new St. Augustine's Bridge would be impassable to shipping. It was therefore decided to enclose that part of the Frome.\r\nA dam was put across the harbour at Thunderbolt Street in February 1892 and the water pumped out. A temporary bridge was erected on the site of the Drawbridge in April or May 1892. A flat-bottomed channel was built roughly centrally between the walls of the Floating Harbour. The walls of this appear to have been of stone and were 1.5 metres thick and stood approximately 5 metres high. On the outside of the walls were low arches placed approximately 1 metre apart. The area between the harbour walls and the culvert was infilled with rubble and then the arch (apparently of brick) was built. At the north end the culvert abutted Stone Bridge which is extant beneath the road, while at the south end it is built against St Augustine's Bridge."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
