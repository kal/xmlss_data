The church was in existence by c1138-1147 when Robert, earl of Gloucester granted it to Turstin as priest (BRO P/St.E/A 1). Latterly the advowson for the rectory belonged to Tewkesbury Abbey which appears to have exercised its right to appoint through its cell St. James Priory (BUAD 1024M). The development of the form of the church is not currently clear but by the late middle ages the church measured 20 metres from north-east to south-west and was 8.5 metres wide. On the north side of the church a tower was attached to the building. The churchyard (BUAD 799M) lay on the north side of the church.\r\nIn October 1399 John Thorp and John Sherp, burgesses of Bristol, gained the agreement of the Crown to establish a chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist in the church and this occupied the south aisle. The same charter also gave them permission to incorporate a fraternity (which later became the Company of Merchant Tailors). The fraternity's book includes an inventory of 1401-02 recording the ornaments of the altar of the chapel, which comprised hangings, vestments of green, gold and ruby and an altar frontal depicting the life of St. John the Baptist (Fox 1880, 13).\r\nAt the dissolution the advowson was acquired by Henry Brayne as part of his purchase of the properties of St. James Priory. The chapel of St. John the Baptist was dissolved in 1547 (Maclean 1883-84, 245) and in 1551 the parish rented the chapel site to the Bristol Corporation to allow the reconstruction and enlargement of the Tolzey (Masters & Ralph, 1967 xiv). In 1637 the tower was rebuilt. The new tower was of two stages with diagonal buttresses and a flat roof. There was a two-centred arch window in north wall of the lower stage. A string course separated the stages.\r\nIn 1657 the Corporation obtained an Act of Parliament to allow it to use the building as a library. The building survived as a parish church, however. The incumbent in the 1730s was Thomas Taylor, described in Bishop Secker's Diocese Book as \"whig, regular, sensible, good\" (McGrath 1985, 36). In 1787 when a further Act of Parliament (28 Geo.III cap. 67) was obtained to merge the parish with Christ Church and to allow demolition of the building. The church was finally demolished in 1820 to enable the construction of Robert Smirke's design for the enlarged Council House (BUAD 342M).\r\nDrawings by Hugh O'Neill made in the 1820s provide some record of the church. He drew the bottom two stages of the tower were drawn in 1820, when it was in use by the Chamberlain for storage of old documents. O'Neill also recorded the demolition of the 1704 Council House (BUAD 341M) and his drawings (Mb2968; Mb2947-Mb2949) show the removal of various parts of the former church, including pointed arches and round-headed and trefoil-headed windows. Architectural fragments were also recovered from the building when it was demolished and O'Neill drew various corbel heads and a boss, in the possession of the antiquarian G. W. Braikenridge or Mr. Garrard the City Chamberlain, in 1822 (M2309-M2312). O'Neill also recorded three fragments of carving, said to be from the old altarpiece in 1823 (Mb14-Mb16)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
