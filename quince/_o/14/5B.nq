The church appears to have stood on the northern side of the friary precinct, close to Rosemary Lane and measured approximately 50 metres from south-west to north-east by 18 metres wide. The precise internal layout of the church is yet to be established but documentary evidence indicates that there were aisles on the north and south side of the nave. There was a also a choir which contained two organs by the early-sixteenth century (Weare 1893, 84-86). The south aisle was refenestrated in the fourteenth century (BUAD 2378). The cloister of the friary was attached to the south side of the church.\r\nThe church was partially demolished after dissolution in 1538 but elements of the fabric survived into the 1930s."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
