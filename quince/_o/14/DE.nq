The kilns were in existence by the late 1820s and were recorded by the 1828 survey of Bristol by John Plumley and George Ashmead. The plan indicates that the kilns were housed in a rectangular building approximately 30 metres from the road. This building was orientated from north-west to south-east and measured 9 metres long by 5.6 metres wide.\r\nThe kilns had been demolished by the early 1880s and their site had become the gardens of Nos.5 and 6 Melrose Place."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
