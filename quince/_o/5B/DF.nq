The structure was located beneath the remains of the Moravian Church, Upper Maudlin Street.\r\nThe building was fragmentary but had stone foundations. Part of a large millstone was excavated, possibly indicating that the structure was a mill. It is possible that the structure excavated to the west in 1976 may be part of the same building.\r\nThe construction of the Bristol Dental Hospital probably destroyed all remains of the structure."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
