The building stood on the east side of the hill and was a three-storey, single-bay jettied house with a gabled front. The ground floor had a bay window on the north side and the entrance door was on south. Above was a full width pentice and the first floor had a central bay window. The attic storey had a single sash in the gable end. The building appears to have had a two-flue chimney stack which projected from the north side of the roof.\r\nThe building was demolished in 1963 to make way for a new road system associated with Bedminster Bridge."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
