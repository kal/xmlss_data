The land for the park was purchased for £300 by Stapleton Urban District Council in 1887 and a pleasure ground was laid out in 1888. At the entrance to the park from Fishponds Road there is a drinking fountain dated 1893. This consists of a Pennant sandstone arch with spigots issuing into marble basins, with an inscription commemorating J. Yalland, Chairman of the Local Board of Health, which was built to commemorate the opening of the park in 1888.  The park was taken over by Bristol Corporation in 1897.\r\nAt the centre of the park is a war memorial (SMR 20115), a bronze statue of a British infantry soldier on large granite plinth, which commemorates the dead of the Gloucestershire regiment during the First World War (1914-1918)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
