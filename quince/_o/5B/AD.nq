It is a steep site, terraced and landscaped with retaining walls. There are ruinous garden buildings and pergolas.\r\nThe land lay within the Sneed Park deer park owned by the Bishops of Worcester. It was granted to Ralph Sadleir at the Reformation and passed into the hands of the Jackson family c.1650. The land was held together by terms of will until 1853 when an act of Parliament (the Martin's Estate Act) set aside the terms of the will. The house known as Bishop's Knoll (SMR 9891) was built in 1874. In the grounds of the villa were gardens and both fruit and vegetable gardens, greenhouses, orchards and a dairy.\r\nIn the Lower area surviving elements of the gardens, including the iron gateway and lower boundary wall, the walls of the lower, second, third and upper terraces and of the orchard, a \"very fine\" wrought iron pergola, a small \"gothic\" possibly a summerhouse. Also extant are an \"L-shaped\" range of buildings, assumed to be a stables, and the remains of the gardener's house.\r\nIn the middle area surviving parts of the garden layout were identified, while in the northern area there are signs of a small gatehouse.\r\nMany different conifers were planted and several are protected by Tree Preservation Orders.
