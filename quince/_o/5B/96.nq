The Sub-control centre is reported to have been built in 1938 as a civil defence control centre and operated as such through the Second World War. After the war the building was used by the Army but reverted to use as a civil defence control centre in the early 1950s, one of four around Bristol. This use continued into the 1960s but most sub-control centres around the UK appear to have downgraded to care and maintenance as the result of a policy review after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. The Bedminster building was abandoned in 1968 and remained unused thereafter (McCamley, 2002 198-199).\r\nThe building is a single-storey concrete structure with a flat roof, which is orientated north-south, and there are slightly lower entrance lobbies at the middle of the north and south elevations. Internally the structure has a central corridor one metre wide running the length of the building, with rooms off it.\r\nThe structure was demolished in 2003 but was surveyed in advance of demolition (SMR 21778; Ross, 2003). There is a photograph of the building in the SMR Collection of Ground-based photographs, number 1851."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
