The house stands on the west side of Wade Street and was built as part of the development of Great Ann Street and Great George Street between 1700 and 1720. This large development, unusually in Bristol at that time, was intended to provide housing for artisans and craftsmen (R. H. Leech 'The processional city: some issues for historical archaeology' in Tarlow & West (eds.) 1999, 19-34).\r\nThe house was surveyed by Roger Leech of RCHME (BUAD 2102). As a result of this work it was concluded that the building originally comprised a single room on each floor with a stair winder next to the chimney stack (Leech 1981, 17)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.

A structure, probably a crane, which stood at the south-west corner of the Marsh, at the entrance to St. Augustine's Reach. A structure which is probably the Gib is shown on Smith's map of the 1560s and is also recorded by documentary evidence from the mid-sixteenth century. It was shown still to be extant by Millerd's map of c1715 but had apparently been removed by the time Jean Rocque made his survey of Bristol in the 1740s."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
