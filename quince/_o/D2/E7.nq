A turret or barbette immediately west of the outside of Blind Gate or St. John's Arch. The tower was built of Pennant Sandstone coursed rubble and Diameter about the same as the width of the arch of the gate, and projecting forward perhaps the same. In January 1821 it was cut back flush with the wall. Prior to removal it was virtually the same height as the walls of the houses on its south side."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
