The hospital was founded by Robert de Berkeley (d.1219) \"for a master and several brethren who should tend the sick and infirm and the needy traveller.\" The hospital was not monastic and the wardenship could be held with another benefice. The bretheren wore the same clothing as secular priests with the wheel of St. Katherine on the left breast (Scott Holmes 1914, lvi-lvii).\r\nThere would appear to have been some problem with the administration of the hospital in 1324-1325 when the register of Bishop Drokensford records that a visitand was commissioned to audit the accounts of the, then master, remove him, and appoint a brother from St. John's Hospital at Redcliff Hill as guardian (Hobhouse 1887, 239).\r\nThe form of the hospital is currently uncertain. Currently direct evidence comes mainly from William Worcestre who, in 1480, recorded the nave of the chapel as measuring approximately 16 yards long by 7 1/2 yards wide. The chancel was roughly 9 yards long by 5 1/2 yards wide\" (Neale 2000, 280-281). Worcester also indicates that there was a cross associated with the hospital (Neale 2000, 94-97).\r\nThe churchwardens accounts of All Saints parish for 1525-1526 record 4d. paid \"to the lazar house at Bright Bowe in bread\" (Burgess 2000, 325) but it is not clear whether the hospital had by then essentially become a leper hospital. By 1548 there were no inmates in the hospital (Green 1888). The hospital survived into the middle of the reign of Elizabeth I, the last recorded master, F. Nevil, being appointed in 1573.\r\nBy 1791 the buildings had been converted to dwellings and the only surviving element was the east end of the chapel where there was a blocked Gothic window (Collinson 1791, 282). These features were apparently demolished in 1887 to make way for construction of a new tobacco factory for W. O. & H. D. Wills (SMR 5494), although Scott Holmes seems to state that at least part of the east end of the chapel was extant when he was writing on the history of the hospital at the beginning of the twentieth century (Scott Holmes in Page 1911, 153)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Chocolate Factory, located on the southern side of Greenbank Road, Easton. The factory was constructed as a chocolate factory for H. J. Packer and Co. H. J. Packer was a former employee of J. S. Fry, and Packer and Co. was founded as a family business in 1881 at No.46 Armoury Square. H. J. Burrows joined the business as a partner in 1884 and became its sole owner in 1885. Burrows sold the business to Bruce Cole the following year. In the second half of the 1890s the business began to expand and acquired adjacent houses in the terrace.\r\nExpansion necessitated the construction of a new factory and a site was acquired in Easton. In 1901 plans for a new factory were approved for construction along Co-operation Road.\r\nThe factory comprised three discrete ranges of brick buildings, each of three storeys and attic with hipped double-Roman tiled roofs, a dormer in the centre of the hip and further small dormers along the length of the roofs. The north-west facing, Co-operation Road, elevations of the eastern and central ranges have five bays while the western range is of three bays. The centre bay of each range consists of large openings for loading doors and the fenestration comprises arched openings containing metal windows. The space between the ranges is covered by ridge lantern lights with steel trusses. Internally the ranges have timber floors with cross-braced joints supported on steel columns. They have king post roofs with tusk tenons, with central steel columns and squared timber posts on either side to support the span.\r\nTo the east, at the junction of Co-operation Road with Thurley Road, an office building was constructed in c.1918. This is a two-storey, four-bay brick building with a limestone ashlar façade. The ground floor is rusticated and the fenestration consists of large metal windows set in recessed openings. Three bays face south-west on to Thurley Road while the fourth, narrower, bay at the south end, turning the corner into Co-operation Road, contains the main semi-circular arched door opening with an similar arched window above. There is a dentillated cornice with a balustraded parapet above. To the south of the factory was a recreation ground for the workers.\r\nA fifth range of buildings was added to the eastern side of the factory in the 1950s. The company was acquired by James Goldsmith in 1964 and renamed Cavendish Confectionery. The firm purchased the Camberley-based firm Elizabeth Shaw in 1968 and moved its production to the Greenbank site where it continued until 2006."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
