A plan of Kingswood of 1610 appears to show a building on the site but Manor House dated to later in the seventeenth century. It was a six-bay, three-storey house of random Pennant sandstone rubble bonded in a white lime mortar with red sandy inclusions. The house measured roughly 8.5 metres long by 6 metres wide and had a single-pile plan. On the northern side of the house there was a large projecting element containing the rear part of the main stair. The original internal plan comprised an entrance hall leading to a centrally-placed main stair with a drawing room on either side of the hall. The stair rose to a landing and appears to have divided into two half-turn stairs, one on either side, to serve first-floor landings (Brett et al. 1994).\r\nThe building was sited on a small promontory and appears to have stood within a large, south-facing garden plot. In an unpublished letter of 22 April 1937 F. C. Jones notes a large block of architectural stone, possibly a gate pier, bearing a crest and sundial with the date 1698 (BRO 33290(12)). The building was the garden house or summerhouse (ie. second residence) of a Bristol merchant dating to the seventeenth century (R. Leech pers. comm.). Drawings by Samuel Loxton produced in the early twentieth century record the St. Mark's Road frontage of the building and the entrance hall. The seventeenth-century central staircase was still extant at that date.\r\nA plan of St. George of 1803 by William Maule indicates that the land parcel within which the house stood was then owned by L. B. Larwill. Manor House was recorded in the local street directories from 1878. In 1897 the building became the Manor House Christian Recreational Institute and later became the East Bristol YMCA. The site was acquired by the builders John Perkins and the fabric substantially altered by conversion into offices. The larger cellar was converted, probably immediately before or at the beginnning of the Second World War, into a works air raid shelter by the creation of an internal framework of rolled steel joists. John Perkins was liquidated in 1993 and the building was demolished in 1994. The remaining elements of the building were subject to archaeological recording before demolition (SMR 10504; Brett et al. 1994). The site was subsequently redeveloped for housing."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
