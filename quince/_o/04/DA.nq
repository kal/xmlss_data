The Ordnance Survey 1:2500-scale first edition County Series plan (Somerset Sheet VI.04) shows that this structure stood on the southern corner of a square of farm buildings around a central yard. By the First World War the majority of the buildings on the north and east sides of the square had been demolished, but the structures along the southern side survived until later in the twentieth century. \r\nThe property that is now No.3 St Anne's Terrace is the last surviving element of this nineteenth century farm. The remains of the chimney breast and part of the side walls of the former building to the west are still evident on the west elevation of the present building."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
