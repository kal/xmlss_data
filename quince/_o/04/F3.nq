This structure was first recorded in 1634 when three soldiers from Norwich wrote 'In the Clysters is a fayre Conduit of Freestone, and leads with many spouts, which continually runs, and waters all the Colledge with that sweet Rockwater' (Blockley 2010, 5).\r\nThe earliest cartograhic depiction of a structure on this site is on Rocque's plan of Bristol of 1742 that indicates a square building in the center of the cloister. Plumley and Ashmead's plan of Bristol (1828) indicates a similar structure that appears to measure approximately 9m square.\r\nIn the Chapter Minutes for 24 December 1853 it was agreed to remove the 'Reservoir and the water House in the Cloister,' (Blockley 2010, 5).\r\nPart of the foundations of this building were recorded during an archaeological watching brief in 2010 (BHER 24898) where it was noted that the building was constructed of Brandon Hill stone bonded in pale red, clayey lime mortar with eighteenth and nineteenth century alterations, although no dating evidence was recovered the chronology being based on mortar types."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
