The mound, known locally as The Tump, was recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition map of the early 1880s and was still extant at the time of the provisional 1:10560 Ordnance Survey map published during the 1940s. It has been suggested that the mound is a barrow, but the feature was in fact formed from soil dumped from mining activity and marks the site of the mine shaft and head works of a coal mine."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
