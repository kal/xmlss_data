The camp consisted of a number of rectangular buildings aligned south-west to north-east, including a group of six linked buildings. These probably included the sleeping quarters, canteen, sickbay etc. for the battery. The camp survived until the late 1950s, being recorded by the Ordnance Survey 1:1250 plan (Sheets ST 6076 and ST 6176) published in 1959, but seems to have been demolished and the site levelled in the early 1960s when the radio repeater station was constructed. Archaeological evaluation (SMR 20970; Stevens 2001) suggested that the foundations of the camp buildings survive beneath parts of the radio station. Two buildings lay on the southern side of Sir John's Lane and these are unlikely to have been disturbed since their demolition."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
