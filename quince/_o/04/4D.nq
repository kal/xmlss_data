The orchard was recorded in 1751 as \"a Place called the old Orchard\" during the perambulation of St. James parish (BRO P/StJ/ChW/6). It is possible that this was originally the orchard of the Dominican Friary."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
