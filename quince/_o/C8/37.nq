The bath was established in the late 1740s. It was recorded by the 1828 survey of Bristol by John Plumley and George Ashmead which shows the bath forming the south-east end of a larger water feature on Cutler's Mill Brook (probably a partially silted millpond serving Cutler's Mills to the north-west) orientated from north-west to south-east. The bath was surrounded by buildings but it is not clear which were ancillary structures. However, the Old England public house is believed to have formed part of the complex by the early-nineteenth century and there was also an associated tea garden (Yorkston 1993). The bath was still operating in the early twentieth century and came into the ownership of Bristol Corporation in 1908. The baths closed in 1917 and the site was subsequently redeveloped."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
