The dock was an ellipsoidal pit measuring 19 metres long by 4 metres wide and cut into the alluvial clay. Excavation in 1978-1979 (BUAD 442) identified the remains of  contemporary structures at the eastern end of the dock which was interpreted as likely to have served a function relating to the dock or dock-side. The dock was filled in soon after the launch, in 1581, of the \"Minion\",. the last ship to be built there."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
