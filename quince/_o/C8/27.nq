The statue comprises the figure of Neptune holding a trident in its right hand and the tail of a large fish or dolphin in its left, the fish curving down to the base of the statue where the left foot of Neptune rests on its head. The figure is of cast lead, originally with an iron armature, and stands on a granite plinth. The bronze plaque on the front of the plinth bears the following legend: \"Neptune a god of the sea according to ancient mythology this lead-covered statue was produced by John Randall founder Bristol 1723 and erected on the site of the old reservoir  of Temple Conduit in Temple Street, re-erected in Bear Lane Temple 1787 - Removed to the junction of Temple Street and Victoria Street in 1872. Erected on this site Latitude 51 27' 06\" north Longitude 2 35' 47\" west 10th May 1949.\" The sculptor is unknown, although a bronze plaque on the pedestal states that the it was produced by a John Randall in 1723. Merritt quotes the accounts for St. Paul's Fair of 1722 record a payment of £32 10s. to John Randall for \"the Figureof Neptune & Peddistoll\" (Merritt, 2002 69).\r\nThe statue originally stood on the head of the Temple conduit but has been moved on several occasions. It was first moved to the east side of Temple Street, at the end of Bear Lane, in 1821. A drawing of 1825 by Delamotte in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery (BRSMG M2170) shows the statue in Church Lane and in 1872 it was moved to the centre of the newly-created Victoria Street (ST 5927672696). The statue was moved to a site at St. Augustine's Reach (ST 5856972774) in the 1940s after a new space was created by the culverting of the section of the Floating Harbour south of St. Augustine's Bridge in 1937.  It was moved again as part of the creation of the Centre Promenade in 1999 and the opportunity was taken to conserve the statue. The leadwork was cleaned and repaired and the iron armature, badly corroded and failing adequately to support the weight of the lead, was replaced with a new armature of stainless steel by Eura Conservation. The statue was erected in its current position (ST 58597289) in November 1999.\r\nThe statue is listed Grade II* (Listed Building number 901-1/16/650)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
