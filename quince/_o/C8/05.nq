The sports ground was constructed at the end of the nineteenth century and was first recorded by the Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 scale plan of 1903 with a stand on the southern side. By the middle of the First World War a larger stand had been constructed on the north side of the site and that on the southern had been considerably enlarged. During the 1980s the stadium was used for greyhound racing. It was demolished in the late 1990s and the site redeveloped."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
