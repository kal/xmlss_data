The land was granted to Ralph Sadleir at the Reformation and passed into the hands of the Jackson family c.1650. The estate was held together by terms of will until 1853 when an act of Parliament (the Martin's Estate Act) set aside the terms of the will. Large villas were built in the following thirty years, including the house known as Bishop's Knoll in 1874 for Peter D. Prankerd.  In the villa had extensive gardens, including fruit and vegetable gardens, greenhouses, orchards and a dairy. The building had passed into the hands of the Bush family by the beginning of the twentieth-century. Robert Bush converted the building into a 100-bed hospital for wounded Australian during the First World War. The house was used to house evacuated industrial concerns during the Second World War and was taken over by Bristol Royal Infirmary as a hostel and training school for nurses. The building was demolished in 1972.\r\nThere are photographs of the building in the SMR collection of ground-based photographs. The surrounding gardens (2200M) survive."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/bristolMonuments>.
