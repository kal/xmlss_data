The form of the almshouse is currently unknown - whether a separate building or accommodation within the chapel - but a kitchen for the almshouse is referred to in a seventeenth-century document, suggesting that it may have been a separate structure close to the chapel building. The almshouse was presumably also served by the priest for the chapel and was funded by a levy on goods and a deduction from the wages of Bristol's mariners which continued to be levied until at least 1595. The Guild of Mariners was dissolved in the mid-sixteenth century and the chapel of St. Clement and the Mariner's Almshouse were taken over by the Society of Merchant Venturers. The almshouse then had twelve residents and subsequently the funds for its maintenance were provided out of the Society's own resources (McGrath 1975, 81).\r\nThe present almshouse building was established in 1696 by the Society of Merchant Venturers. The building enclosed a quadrangle, with full ranges on the north, east and west sides and the southern range split by a main entrance at the centre of that side. There was a uniform for those accepted into the almshouse consisting of a long dark blue overcoat with a blue-green lining and a hat (BRSMG M2502).\r\nThe almshouse was damaged by blast in an air raid on 2 December 1940.

These involved use of College Green  on which the hospital had grazed its animals and buried some of its dead (Ross 1959, 7-10). In 1491 the Abbey of St. Augustine claimed that the hospital fell within its manorial jurisdiction, beginning another long dispute in which the Bristol authorities became involved.\r\nIn 1534 the hospital community had five members. Four brothers and the master, John Colman, were still present at the time of the hospital's dissolution on 9th December 1539.

The history of gas works was assessed by Manco (Manco \"Historical Background\" in Gilmore Hankey Kirke 1995) but this account was superceded by the results of a programme of work on the site by RemedX in 1998. This included a review of the documentary history of the site and full rectified photogrammetric survey of the surviving buildings (BUAD 3339). A watching brief was also undertaken in 1998 during groundworks on the site of the Governor House (Erskine 1998).\r\nSix phases of development were identified the RemedX study (RemedX 1998). During the first phase, from 1824 to 1836, The gas works was created by the Bristol and Clifton Oil Gas Company to produce gas from oil, primarily whale oil. The Plumley and Ashmead's 1828 map of Bristol indicates that the gas works initially occupied only the plot against the east side of Gasferry Road. The production process was housed in a single retort house towards the north end of the site, with a single stone rubble gasholder with a domed roof to the south of this. The upper part of this structure is recorded in a painting of 1837 by W. J. Muller showing Bristol from Clifton Wood (Bristol Museum and Art Gallery K1542). There was also a range of outbuildings. During Phase 2, between 1836 and 1841, the gas works was converted from oil gas to coal gas production when the former became uneconomic. The retort house was modified with new equipment and the range of outbuildings converted into a purifier house. The only surviving fabric from the first two phases of activity is part of the boundary wall along Gasferry Road. During the third phase, 1841 to 1848, the plant was modernised and expanded. Amongst other changes, the site of the ropewalk (BUAD 1282M) on the east side of the gas works was acquired and a larger coal store built there. A new underground Tar and Liquor tank was constructed and new lime purifiers were installed in the purifier house. On the south side of the site, by the north side of Canon's Road, two new gasholders were constructed, as was a landing place for unloading coal was created. In Phase 4, 1848-1860, another acre of land was purchased on the east side of the works and new offices, the main elevation of which is extant in the boundary wall on Canons Road, were constructed overlooking the Floating Harbour. This five-bay building was only a single storey in height. A new gasholder was also built on the newly-acquired land and the Phase 3 coal store converted to a retort house. The Phase 1 gasometer house meanwhile was converted to a purifier house. In 1853 the company was amalgamated with the Bristol Gas Light Company (which operated the Avon Street gas works) to form the Bristol United Gas Company. Phase 5, 1860 to 1870, saw further expansion of the site. The plot on the west side of Gasferry Road was purchased in 1860 and a new purifier house and gasholder erected there. The Phase 1 retort house and gasometer house were demolished along with the Phase 3 gasometers by Canon's Road. The eastern of these was roofed with brick arches to form a new underground liquor tank. Phase 6, 1870-1949, saw the acquisition of more land to the east of the plant. Germaine's timber yard was purchased in 1870 and a second block of land to the east of this probably in the mid- to late-1940s. A new gasholder (No.3) and a new retort house were built, the latter in two phases but completed by 1886. During the twentieth century a carburetted water gas plant, a concentrated liquor plant and a benzole plant were installed. A new jetty for unloading coal from the Floating Harbour was also created. Gas production at the site continued into the post-war period but by 1970 the works were derelict and in 1972 a number of the buildings were demolished.\r\nWhat remains above ground of the buildings of the first three phases of the gas works is represented in the boundary wall of the site. The buildings on the west side of Gasferry Road, the purifier (ST 57903 72530), the No.1 gas holder (ST 57935 72530) and engine house (ST 57937 72498), date to between 1848 and 1860 but the majority of the surviving structures, almost all to the east of Gasferry Road, date to the period after 1870. These include the purifier house and its 1886 extension (ST 57990 72521), the No.3 gasholder towards the east end of the site (ST 58102 72507), the retort house (ST 58072 72440) and coal store (ST 58085 72473) of 1870 and the engine and dynamo house of 1908 (ST 58033 72487).\r\nThe purifier houses, retort house and boundary wall have a Grade II listing (Listed Building numbers 501, 504, 508).

A desire to erect a monument to the fallen of World War I emerged in the early 1920s but nothing came of the first effort and in the meantime Bristol's Remembrance Day services were held around a temporary cenotaph approximately two metres high which was erected annually on St. Augustine's Bridge [BUAD 539M] in the Tramway Centre.\r\nA second attempt to create a memorial was made in the mid-1920s by the newly-established Bristol branch of the British Legion. Opinion was divided over whether to create a reverential public monument or to establish a memorial with a more practical function, particularly to support disabled servicemen. A committee was established to campaign for funds and College Green, then occupied by the Replica High Cross [BUAD 40M] was proposed as a site but this was opposed by the Dean and Chapter, who owned College Green. An alternative site in the footway in front of the Church of St. Augustine-the-Less was also rejected. The council did, however, fund construction of a small housing estate at Bethune in northern France at this time as memorial.\r\nA third attempt to create a memorial in the late 1920s proved successful. A site was allocated at the northern end of the Tramway Centre and the council provided £790 to prepare it in July 1931. The design for the memorial was selected by means of an architectural competition. Eighteen submitted designs were reduced to a shortlist of three by G. C. Lawrence FRIBA, an assessor selected by the President of the Royal Insititute of British Architects. The three shortlisted designs, by C. R. Beechcroft, Adrian E. Powell and the practice of H. Heathman and Miss E. Blacker, were published in the Bristol Evening Times and Echo for the public to vote on. The winning design was that by Heathman and Blacker, and this was built during the first half of 1932. The cenotaph was unveiled by Field-Marshal Sir William Birdwood, who commanded the ANZAC forces during the First World War, on Sunday 16th July 1932 at a ceremony involving the council, armed and civilian services, the Bishop of Bristol and representatives of other religious denominations.\r\nThe monument is a tepaering rectangular slab of Portland stone set on a stepped plinth with plain square blocks approximately 1.1 metres high at each corner. The top is moulded in the form of a fascine with scrolled consoles at either end and a sarcophagus on top. At the centre of both the north-east and south-west faces is a large wreath with a central sword. The dates \"1914\" and \"1918\" were carved below the wreath, on either side of the sword. The dates \"1939\" and \"1945\" were subsequently added. Below the dates are bronze plaques with a band of roundels containing service badges, including those of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force, running around the monument at the level of the plaques. The plaque on the north-east face of the monument carries the legend:\r\n\"O VALIANT HEARTS, WHO TO YOUR GLORY CAME\r\nTHROUGH DUST OF CONFLICT AND THROUGH BATTLE-FLAME:\r\nTRANQUIL YOU LIE, YOUR KNIGHTLY VIRTUE PROVED\r\nYOUR MEMORY HALLOWED IN THE LAND YOU LOVED\r\nSPLENDID YOU PASSED, THE GREAT SURRENDER MADE\r\nINTO THE LIGHT THAT NEVERMORE SHALL FADE\r\nALL YOU HAD HOPED FOR, ALL YOU HAD, YOU GAVE\r\nTO SAVE MANKIND, YOUSELVES YOU SCORNED TO SAVE.\"\r\nThe plaque on the south-west face is inscribed:\r\n\"SACRED TO THE MEMORY\r\nOF BRISTOL'S SONS AND\r\nDAUGHTERS WHO MADE\r\nTHE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE\"\r\nThe mention of \"daughters\" is unusual and possibly unique (Dr. C. Moriarty pers. comm.).\r\nOn the narrow, south-east and north-west facing, sides are the arms of the City of Bristol in bronze.\r\nSome 10 metres from each of the square blocks at corners of the plinth there are four bronze openwork lamp standards with globe lamps each with a lion's head roundel on every side.\r\nThe cenotaph has a Grade II listing (Listed Building No. 901-1/11/551). The bronze lamp standards are listed separately (Listed Building No. 901-1/11/552) and are also Grade II. The monument is owned and maintained by Bristol City Council. The stonework is currently [14/06/2001] suffering erosion probably attributable to pollution.

In 1837, taking advantage of the proximity of the GWR terminus and the availability of coal, Henry Stothert bought part of the former brick yards on the east side of Avon Street to establish a works to construct engines, particularly railway locomotives for the Great Western Railway (Davies et al. in Harvey & Press 1988, 111). There were several discrete departments within the works, including an iron foundry, brass foundry, forge (which operated through the night as well as by day) and boiler-making, erecting and fitting shops. Clark reported in 1850 that the coke ovens of the works had become a local nuisance (Clark 1850, 82). By the mid-1860s the works employed over 700 men and 100 boys, although Edward Slaughter informed the agent of the Commissioners on the Employment of Children that the company only employed those over the age of 15 (Children's Employment Commission 1866, 62-63). The company had an important domestic market but was also exporting locomotives to railways across the world because of a willingness to supply the particular requirements of their customers. It suffered, like other locomotive builders across the country, from the consequences of the downturn in railway investment and went into liquidation in July 1881. The buildings were sold to John Mardon Ltd. and some put into use for papermaking while the Vulcan Ironworks moved into others. However, locomotive production continued until 1905 in a much reduced area of the site on the north side of Kilkenny Street leased by Edwin Walker after he acquired the Avonside machinery and patterns in 1882. The eastern part of the site had become the Midland Railway Lower Yard by August 1896 (Davies et al. in Harvey & Press 1988). The engine works removed to the suburbs in the 1900s, after which the buildings found other uses. All of the surviving buildings were recorded by the R.C.H.M.E in 1996 (BUAD 457), shortly before demolition (Cattell 1996; 1997)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The almshouse is reputed to have been founded in 1292 by Simon Burton, mayor of Bristol, although Paterson argues that the attribution was more likely to have derived from a later mayor, John Burton who founded a chantry in St. Thomas Church which later funded repair works to the almshouse (Paterson 1939, 320-321).\r\nThe medieval form of the almshouse is uncertain but its plan appears to have been similar to the later building, though Marochan and Reed suggest it was larger than the later structure. There appear to have been a statue on either side of the main entrance, representing St. Thomas the Martyr and St. John the Baptist (Paterson 1939, 320). By 1550 there were twenty-four inmates, twelve men and twelve women.\r\nThe almshouse was rebuilt in 1606 and was rebuilt again in 1721. This structure is recorded by several nineteenth-century drawings and photographs and was a two storey building, probably of five bays. There was an entrance at the centre of the main, north-west facing, elevation above which a was large plaque under its own pediment. The legend was recorded by George Weare Braikenridge as reading: \"This Almshouse was Erected in the year 1292 For Sixteen Persons By Simon Burton Esqr & Rebuilt Anno Domini 1721 He was Five times MAYOR of this City & the Original Founder of St. Mary Redcliff Church\". The fenestration consisted of cross-windows. There was a raised area in front of the building, with access from either end through doorways and up steps. The front boundary wall was raised above these doorways and there were four arched cellar openings with grilles at the base of wall.\r\nThe almshouse was damaged by bombing during the Second World War and was demolished in the 1950s. The front wall plaque was removed to Bristol Museum, but is badly damaged. Keith Marochan and Keith Reed monitored groundworks associated with the redevelopment of the site in 1959 (BUAD 3079; Marochan and Reed 1959)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

In his will of December 1753 Alderman William Vick, a Bristol wine merchant, bequeathed £1000 to the Society of Merchant Venturers to pay for a bridge across the Avon Gorge. Little was done for some decades but after pressure for action on the scheme from the Chamber of Commerce the Society formed a committee to oversee the project. By 1829 the funds available from Vick's legacy had reached £8000 and a trust was created in 1830. It was intended to raise the necessary additional money through loans and public donations and £22,007 was raised in this way, the great majority from loans (Portman 2002, 5). The committee obtained an Act of Parliament to allow the building of a toll bridge (11Geo.IV c69) in May 1830.\r\nAn architectural competition, judged by Thomas Telford, was held in 1829 and ended with Telford rejecting all 22 proposals (including one from I. K. Brunel). Consequently in late-1830 a second competition was held, the Trustees having invited Telford to submit his own design. The second competition was judged by Davies Gilbert, past president of the Royal Society who had worked on the Menai Bridge, and John Seaward, an iron founder, and was won by I. K. Brunel (Rolt 1957, 53-55). Brunel submitted four designs for a suspension bridge with detailing ranging from Gothic to Egyptian and employed the local artist Samuel Jackson to produce views of the proposed designs (Greenacre & Stoddard 1986, 48-55). The final design incorporated elements of Brunel's No.2 and No.3 designs combined with the Egyptian detailing which characterised his No.4 design. Gilbert raised a number of concerns based on his experience at Menai and I. K. Brunel and his father Marc Isambard Brunel made alterations to the scheme to take these on board. A shortfall in the available funds meant that the scheme was cut down to a cost of £45,000 and construction was to take four years.\r\nWork began on the Somerset side of the Gorge and on 27 August 1836 the foundation stone for the Leigh Woods abutment was laid but the contractors building the Somerset abutment, Orton & Paxton, went bankrupt in 1837. Construction of the Clifton abutment was started in 1838. The pylons were substantially completed but construction halted in 1840 because funds were exhausted. The chains for the bridge, which had already been manufactured but not completely paid for, were sold on and used on Brunel's Royal Albert Bridge across the river Tamar in 1853 (Buchanan & Cossons 1969, 183).\r\nIn 1859 the engineer John Hawkshaw decided to complete the Clifton bridge. The piers were in sound condition and a new company was formed to which the original Trustees sold the assets in return for £2,000 in shares. The proposal was redesigned to enable the bridge to be built at minimum cost and the chains from Brunel's Hungerford Bridge in London were acquired (Porter Goff 1974). Sir Greville Smyth of Ashton Court supported the scheme but demanded a wider roadway and agreed to provide the £5000 needed. A new Act of Parliament was obtained for the completion of the bridge on 28 June 1861 and as one of its clauses this reserved an element of any operating profits to the Trustees. They would thereby be able to reduce the debt on the bridge by gradually purchasing the shares in the Company, ultimately wind up the trust and operate the bridge as a toll bridge. Construction resumed in November 1862 with Hawkshaw and W. H. Barlow acting as engineers to the project.\r\nThe bridge was opened on 8 December 1864 with a procession through Bristol to the bridge. An artillery salute by guns of the Volunteer Artillery sited in Leigh Woods was followed by an opening ceremony attended by the Directors of the Company, the Lords Lieutenants for Gloucestershire and Somerset, the Mayor of Bristol and the Bishop of Bristol at the bridge itself (Barnes 1928, 35-40).\r\nThe bridge consists of square red sandstone ashlar abutments with Pennant sandstone walls, and squared Pennant sandstone rubble pylons with limestone dressings. The pylons have battered fronts and backs, and are canted half-way up the sides to deep coved cornices. They are pierced by segmental-arched vehicle arches and these have parabolic arches above. The eastern pylon has narrow pointed-arched side openings and is constructed as a series of large arched vaults.\r\nThe Trust completed the purchase of the shares in 1952 and on 1 August 1952 an Act of Parliament was obtained to reincorporate the Trustees and allow the bridge to function as a toll bridge.\r\nClifton Suspension Bridge has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/7/750)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The church is thought to have been founded c.1192 and the advowson of the rectory was in the gift of Tewkesbury Abbey.\r\nThe rector of St. John in 1420 was John Mybbys, probably the former principal of Cuthbert Hall, Oxford who had participated in the Lollard rising led by Sir John Oldcastle in the spring of 1414. In August 1420 he acted as compurgator for William Taylor during the latter's trial on six charges of heresy (Thomson 1965, 25n).\r\nC14 and C15; late sixteenth-century vestry; narthex and side gateways formed later 1820s. Rubble with limestone dressings and limestone ashlar tower and spire. \r\nNave, chancel and east vestry. Tower over gateway (originally shared with St.Lawrence). Perpendicular Gothic style.\r\nThe north elevation includes at the east end St John's conduit, beneath a nineteenth-century four-centred arch; above is a fifteenth-century canted oriel window; to the west is an octagonal chimney on a corbel; a deep drip over the C14 crypt of 6 bays, refenestrated with low, C15 three-light Tudor-arched windows, the west one blocked, and a small Tudor-arched ribbed door; 2-bay late C15 chancel of 3-light windows with a shallow buttress in between; C14 four-bay nave of larger 3-light windows, and a short 4-light Tudor-arched clerestory window above the first bay, with a crenellated parapet. \r\nSouth elevation of the chancel is 3 bays, windows as the north side with 2 doorways at either end with chamfered Tudor arches; at the west end of the chancel the nave steps out and is linked by an angled wall on corbels; the south nave wall is similar to the north, without the crypt windows. \r\nAt the west end is the gateway. The south side of the central gateway has flanking niches with painted statues of Brennus and Bellinus, the mythical founders of Bristol, each holding an orb and sceptre; shields and a Royal Arms to the parapet above; the east arch is paired with the entrance to the church. \r\nThe main gateway has a ribbed fan vault with bell hole, also portcullis slot. The two-stage tower has an octagonal spire. \r\nAt lower level there is a crypt or crowde [969A] in 2 sections: that to the east is 3 bays, a tierceron vault with bosses; west section is 2 bays, with a more complex tierceron ribbed vault with bosses but no shafts; 2 stoops, by door and in south-west corner with a projecting shield. The crowde was illustrated by Rowbotham in 1826, with views from both ends (M2425-M2426).\r\nA two-bay chancel with relief crenellation across the middle of east wall, and 3 fine Tudor-arched studded doors with raised lozenges in panels; an arch and steps up behind the south chancel arch pier to the pulpit; 6-bay nave has splayed window reveals and attached shafts between the bays, with painted octagonal capitals; the raised east bay has clerestory windows to former rood loft and a C15 roof with tie beams and posts to angel corbels, while the rest has a timber cornice to a shallow C15 arch-braced collar beam roof; narthex with open-well stair of 1883 to the organ loft.\r\nAfter the dissolution of St. James, the advowson of the rectory was acquired by Henry Brayne as part of his purchase of the St. James property in January 1544.\r\nFine Laudian fittings. A gated altar rail with twisted banisters, 2 lecterns, pews of 1621 with doors and a partially restored C17 west screen and organ loft with painted panels and fluted pilasters; brass 2-sided lectern c1690, and a C18 wrought-iron sword rest; a fine 1624 font. A rare hour-glass (held in the City Museum) from the time of the Commonwealth is attached beside the octagonal pulpit. Various memorials include a wall tablet, the Rowley Brass, to Thomas Rowley d.1478, with inscribed figures; table tomb to Walter Frampton d.1388 in an elliptical-arched recess in the chancel. \r\nWalter Frampton was chief benefactor for St John's until his death in 1388. The crypt or crowde provided space for guild or chantry chapels, another example standing in the Church of St Nicholas (BUAD 147M).\r\nThe interior was recorded by Rowbotham in 1826 (M.2396) and Johnson in 1828 (M2397). Both show the pulpit raised above the central gangway. Illustrations, also, of the font (O'Neill, M2402), communion table (Rowbotham M2406), hour-glass (O'Neill M.2411; M2411a), Frampton tomb (M2413-M2417), Rowley brass (M2420), other monuments and internal fittings, etc.\r\nAn organ was built in 1846 by John Smith junior of the Bristol organ builders John Smith and Sons (Felix Farley's Bristol Journal, 21 February 1846).\r\nThe church was declared redundant in 1984 and the congregation moved to the Chapel of the Three Kings of Cologne.\r\nThe church has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number )."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The hillfort stood on the east side of the Avon Gorge and forms part of a cluster of three Iron Age hillforts, with Stokeleigh Camp and Burwalls on the western side of the Gorge. The ditches enclose an area of approximately three acres and Burrow (1981, 76; 235-236) argues that the \"defences appear to have been bivallate with an entrance on the E[ast].\" The entrance has been slightly affected by quarrying. It lies just north of present path into camp from the east and has an over-lapping counterscarp bank. In the north-west corner is a rectangular earthwork (SMR 3223). Sections cut by the Clifton Antiquarian Club through the south-east bank of this earthwork, and through the low bank leading from it towards the observatory, revealed no dating evidence, although the latter appeared almost certainly to be later than the inner vallum of the original camp. Roman coins (SMR 3224) and flints (SMR 3225) have also been found within and around the hillfort.\r\nThe hillfort was described by William Worcestre in 1480 (SMR 20588; Neale 2000, 34-35), by John Aubrey in the later seventeenth century (SMR 20659; Fowles 1980, 374-375) and a number of local antiquarians (eg. Seyer 1821, 60-61). Part of the outer earthworks of the camp are reported to have been levelled by Sir William Draper in the mid to late eighteenth century. There has been significant erosion by limestone quarrying on the west side and the construction of Suspension Bridge Road to the south also cut into the hillfort.\r\nA windmill was built inside the hillfort in 1776 but was destroyed by fire soon after, and was rebuilt as the Observatory (SMR 1031) in 1828-29. A reservoir is also known to have been constructed inside the hillfort in the nineteenth-century. The hillfort is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (AV29)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The Ordnance Survey map of 1921 shows both the semi circular and the long enclosure, both planted with trees. The monument was surveyed by Dr. Mark Corney in December 2003 (Corney 2003).

The principal elevation is symmetrical with a pedimented 3-window centre set forward, a rusticated ground floor, pedestal course to four Corinthian columns to the centre and pilasters to the sides. The main entrance in the Corn Street facade is a semi-circular arched doorway with rusticated reveals and heavy arched double doors with studs and cast-iron lion-head knockers. The ground-floor windows have incised voussoirs, and the first-floor windows Corinthian pilaster jambs with entablature and pediments. They are alternately triangular and segmental, with a central Venetian window, and square second-floor windows. Below the frieze is a band of well-detailed swag and festoon to human and animal heads symbolising trade, and a Royal Coat of Arms in the tympanum. The majority of the original fabric is Pennant sandstone rubble.\r\nWood's design included a coffee house and a tavern at the north-east and north-west corners of the building, respectively. Along the east and west sides of the building there were individual houses, each of which consisted of a single room on each floor with a cellar, a kitchen at semi-basement level and other accommodation above, including a counting house. Two of the kitchens on the eastern side of the building retain many of their fittings as does one of the counting houses on the west side.\r\nThere have been significant campaigns of alteration to the building throughout its life. The floors of the cellars in the centre of the building were lowered c.1811-1813 when the Exchange became the Corn Exchange. Another major scheme was carried through in 1872 by the architect E. M. Barry. The central courtyard was roofed and a new suite of offices was created on the first floor, above the colonnades around the court. There were further changes after the Second World War. The clock tower over the south range was removed and the four floors of the coffee house and the main entrance were rebuilt internally. The current roof over the central courtyard dates to 1949.\r\nWood published a short description of the building and an account of its building (Wood, 1745) and a study of its building was made by Priest in 1980. The most complete examination, however, has been a full measured survey and interpretation made in 1998 by Dr. Roger Leech (BUAD 3374) which identified the extent of the surviving original fabric and phased the various alterations (Leech, 1998). The original inner gates to The Exchange are currently located in the Industrial Museum.\r\nThe building has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/11/578)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

It was constructed c.1746. The building is of three storeys plus attic and is constructed of limestone ashlar with lateral ashlar stacks and a hipped roof. The symmetrical front has a three-window range and has a pedimented centre set forward, plinth, rusticated quoins, cornice and parapet. The ground-floor windows are semicircular arches with glazing dating to the twentieth century and central glazed double doors. There are pediments to first-floor windows and a wide dormer. The left-hand return is a 11-window range: right-hand 3-window range as the front, with OLD POST OFFICE inscribed in the plat band; to the left 4:1:3 windows, with a raised entrance section set back containing a tall doorway with Gibbs surround, a pedimented first-floor window and a semicircular-arched second-floor window beneath a cartouche with festoon. Each side are windows as the front. The interior is open plan with a central stairwell, largely remodelled late twentieth century; the side doorway, in Exchange Avenue, leads to an open-well stair. At the beginning of the twentieth century the rear part of the Old Post office was rebuilt to designs by Sir George Oatley, extending the building south to take in the site of the northern two shops of a row of four probably designed by R. S. Pope c.1848 (BUAD 1394M). The building was part rebuilt as a facsimile in 1993.

Early eighteenth-century illustrations exist of the church and gate, suggesting a fourteenth-century date. Much of the fine largely fourteenth-century crowde, or lower church (973A) survives. It has two aisles and four bays with tierceron vaulting and good animate and foliate bosses; at the east end of the south aisle is an arched panel with good figure stops and a hexafoil panel. There is evidence of a former fifth bay at the west end of the southern aisle. The remains of an earlier vault survive east of the northern aisle. Beyond is a small vaulted area, used as a charnel house (970A), with two charnel pits (971A), one at each end. Four phases of construction in the crowde - east end of north aisle, running into the charnel house; eastern two full bays of same; western two ditto; the south aisle. In the south wall is the matrix for a 16th. or 17th.century memorial brass. Beyond the south-east corner are the remains of a staircase that linked with the chancel above.

The interior was largely rebuilt and the pre-war double gabled roof was replaced by a flat roof. The brass eagle lectern of c1480, William Edney's gates, and the sword rest have all been removed to St. Stephen's Church (qv).

The building is a three-storey house with two bow window bays of nineteenth-century date on the south frontage. The building is currently rendered with limestone dressings and has a pan tile hipped roof with brick ridge stacks. Adjoining the house is a small lawned area to the north and an open yard or driveway extends around the east and south sides of the property. Ruinous structures, possibly a former brewhouse adjoin the house to the northwest. A terraced walk approaches the house from the west alongside the south boundary wall of Goldney House garden.\r\nThe main building has apparently developed in four main phases from the later seventeenth- or early-eighteenth century (Leech, 2003). The earliest structural element of the house survives, though much altered, as the western third of the present house. This earliest structure is likely to have been a \"lodge\" or \"summer house\" (a merchant's second residence) constructed between 1690 and 1710 and measuring approximately 5 metres east-west and 11 metres north-south. This original house was subject to alteration and enlargement, possibly by the Quaker builder George Tully in 1723 (Mowl 1992, 23),  between 1722 and 1728 while in the ownership of Robert Smith to create a double-pile house with three bays. This enlarged building consisted of three storeys with a cellar below the north-east room, with a central hall and stairs extending the full depth of the house on the ground floor. The main stairs as built ascended only to the first floor, there being a separate servants stair (long since removed) to the east of the hall rising from the ground to the first and attic floors. This stair was one of the earliest such features in Bristol, the only other similar example being No.32 Prince Street (a plan of the latter is in the Kingsweston Book of Drawings (R. Leech pers. comm.). On the ground floor there were three reception rooms and a kitchen with projecting scullery wing to the north. There were four chambers on the first floor and five rooms in the attic, probably servants quarters. The ground floor entrance hall and reception rooms and the first floor front chambers were fully panelled with plaster cornices. The wide main stairs to the first floor were provided with marquetry inlays to the newel post, to the panelled wainscot, to the panels to the floor and underside of the upper quarter landing and to the soffit balustrade at the first floor. Most of the doors were of six panels raised and fielded in three heights, the two central panels roughly half the height of those above and below.\r\nIn 1748 the house and estate was sold to Thomas Goldney who leased the property to Selina Countess of Huntingdon, there in 1753 (Leech 2003). From 1757 the property was leased to Richard Farr a merchant and owner of ships engaged in the slave trade, who in 1769 agreed to an increased rent to pay for new work on the house that included a new laundry and enlargement of the brewhouse, possibly one of the outbuildings now ruinous on the site.\r\nIn the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century the house was subject to several alterations and modernisation. New stairs were added from the first to second floor above the entrance hall and the servants' stairs were removed. In the south-east room on the second floor wall cloth placed above a panelled dado replaced earlier plaster and panelled finishes. The dado height panelling in other rooms was possibly fitted at a similar stage. The new stairs from the first to second floors differ from the earlier main stairs, having thinner turned column balusters than the original stairs and a moulded handrail characteristic of the later eighteenth century (Leech 2003). On the ground and first floors the space occupied by the servants' stairs became a closet, the corresponding space on the second floor became a cupboard and the location for new stairs onto the roof. \r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century two bow windows were added to the south-east facing elevation their construction is described by Leech (2003) as 'economical', boarded panels below the windows providing the appearance of solid walls. \r\nIn 1864 the property was sold to Lewis Fry. By the time of the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXV.4.2) surveyed in 1883 the building was in use as a \"Home for crippled children\".\r\nIn 1924 a china pantry, scullery and an external WC were added to the ground floor. On the first floor a new room was added over the new scullery. Plans for these additions indicate that the ground floor south facing window in the south-west angle had been blocked by 1924 to become a cupboard.\r\nTo the west of the house are the ruins of a former necessary house with a stone slab covered earth closet and a former building with a wide fireplace now blocked. This is possibly the former back kitchen or brewhouse constructed in the 1760s. The original roofs of these structures have long since been removed. Further to the west at the end of the long terrace stood a summerhouse, now demolished.  Approximately 7m to the north of the main house an octagonal structure is shown on the plans of 1828 and 1885, possibly a summerhouse, in the area now laid to lawn.\r\nWithin the present garden the main historic feature is the terrace walk, now restored, that approaches the house from the west alongside the boundary wall with the Goldney House gardens to the north. This terrace walk and adjoining boundary walls are likely to date to c.1750 as does the low boundary wall at the west end of the garden. The wall towards the south side of the garden adjoinig Randall Road is not historically a boundary wall, it is the truncated part of a terrace wall within a former orchard shown on the nineteenth century plans. At the east end a wall of the 1880s (with a single door opening towards Randall Road) links this wall to the wall originally separating the inner courtyard in front of the main house from its formal garden (SMR 21731) to the south, separated before 1828 for a new house and garden. A feature of this wall is the projecting rectangular bastion. Since the Randall Road development of the 1880s there has been no boundary wall to the south side of the property. The north boundary wall is built in Brandon Hill Stone laid as random rubble. This wall is shown on the 1828 Ashmead plan and is probably built against the earlier north-south boundary wall against which the original house of 1690-1710 was constructed. The east boundary wall is of unknown date, although it is possibly that shown on the nineteenth century plans.\r\nA stable block (also Grade II listed, Listed Building number 901-1/41/822) associated with Clifton Wood House lies ten metres north of the house. This is a single storey rendred structure with limestone dressings and a pantile hipped roof.

The monument measured 40 feet in diameter, 2 feet high. It was excavated in 1924 by Tratman, and a cremation with parts of an Iron Age \"A\" carinated bowl was recorded. Finds included, the iron cheek piece of a bridle, two fragments of samian from under the turf, now in the University of Bristol Spelaeological Society Museum.\r\nTratman attributed the barrows on Kings Weston Hill (SMR 761, 784,785) to the Iron age. O'Neill and Grinsell (1960) imply that the Iron Age cremation may have been secondary. Though inconclusive, the excavations suggest a Late Bronze Age date for the barrow, with other material in secondary position. Three small round barrows excavated in about 1924 by Tratman seem to have contained primary cremations with Iron Age A pottery. Green briefly reviewed the dating evidence available for the barrows at Kingsweston Hill in considering a cairn he had excavated at Tickenham. On the basis of a re-examination of Tratman's pottery finds, which appeared to be from collared urns, Green concluded that \"in the absence of any structural grounds for considering the Kings Weston Hill barrows to be of Iron Age date\" the Kingsweston barrows were of Early Bronze Age origin (Green 1972-73, 43-44). Tratman replied to Green's reinterpretation, arguing that the interpretation of the pottery as Iron Age was questionable, the monuments had not necessarily been disturbed to any great extent in antiquity and that the argument that absence of structural grounds for an Iron Age date leads to the inference of a date in the Early Bronze Age was \"highly specious\". Tratman concluded that there was no good reason to redate the Kingsweston barrows until fresh evidence became available (Tratman 1975, 56-57)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The railway was built in 1864 across the mill stream.\r\nThe mill buildings, including the house survive as Mill Cottage which was derelict in 1967 but which has now been restored.

Sarah Ridley died in 1726 and the site was purchased in 1735. Five small houses had previously ocupied the site but were then reported to be \"decayed and in great part fallen down\" (Manchee, 1831 195). Building commenced in 1738 and was completed August 1740, and a total £860 was spent to establish the almshouse (Manchee, 1831 195).\r\nThe almshouse measured 20.5 metres from east to west and was 13.5 metres north-south and was of two storeys with a hipped slate roof. The Milk Street elevation had a five-window range and at either end there were a pair of slightly projecting side wings, each with a one-window range.\r\nAt first-floor, a round-headed recess contained a plaque which, in accordance with the terms of Sarah Ridley's will, carried the legend: \"In Memory of Mr Thomas Ridley and Sarah Ridley Being Brother and Sister Never Married Erected Anno Dom 1739.\" otherwise cross-windows, as at both storeys of wings, also in side elevations and insides of wings. The Old King Street elevation had a three-window range with a projecting centre bay.\r\nThe building was unusual in having casement windows at so late a date.\r\nThere were some additions of perhaps 1741.\r\nThe almshouse was damaged by bombing during the Second World War, was subsequently designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It was, however, removed to make way for the development of the new Broadmead shopping centre. The building was recorded by the Ministry of Works prior to its demolition (BUAD 920; O'Neill, 1951). The plaque commemorating the founder and her brother was removed when the building was demolished and is now in the collections of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery.\r\nA drinking fountain was located in an arched recess, in a larger gabled structure, in the boundary wall against Old King Street.

Factory Chittening, located on the western side of Chittening Road. The factory was established by the Ministry of Munitions in October 1917 to manufacture the blister agent mustard gas (sulphur mustard - 1,1-thiobis(2-chloroethane)) in response to German use of the weapon in the early stages of the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele) and Nobel's Explosives were instructed to construct a plant at the site to manufacture thiodiglycol, a mustard gas precursor, in December 1917. Progress with construction of the factory appears to have been slow and site clearance was still in progress when a strike stopped work throughout most of March 1918 (Haber 1986, 164). Construction of the mustard gas facility was abandoned in April 1918 and production moved to a new factory at Avonmouth (SMR 21403; located on the south side of Kingsweston Lane) which was constructed in May and June (National Archives MUN 4/1696; Haber 1986, 165; Hartcup 1988, 109). The Chittening factory was re-equipped for filling artillery shells and began to operate on 8 July 1918. Initially part of the site was given over to production of chloropicrin, a vomiting and lachrymatory agent in its own right, which is commonly mixed with mustard gas to raise its freezing point and hence its battlefield dispersal (Sidell et al 1997, 201). Later in July the plant started to produce mustard gas shells. However, manufacturing problems at the Avonmouth factory meant that the site worked at well below its capacity until September (Haber 1986, 191). The filling of mustard gas shells at the plant was extremely hazardous and 1213 gas injuries were reported at Chittening between 21 June and 7 December 1918 (Haber 1986, 249). To counter the extremely high sickness and absenteeism rates which resulted, the hours of work were reduced and an entitlement to a week's holiday for every 20 days worked introduced (Haber 1986, 251-252). However, the Treasury was still agreeing compensation payments for injured workers in 1920 (National Archives T 1/12456).\r\nAccording to a plan dated 27 November 1918 (National Archives MUN 4/1753) the factory was served by a platform on the railway line to the south-west of the site and a road led to what may have been be a pair of gatehouses with time clocks a short distance to the west. There was a large canteen building to the south-west and the dirty change house and clean change house (both with associated detached lavatories) to the north-west. The site itself was arranged on a grid pattern. Isolated on the north-west side was the laboratory with stores, the engine shop, repair shop, laundry and boiler house to the south-east. The railway ran from the north past these buildings and south of the canteen to pass north-east around the core of the site. Inside the railway were large receiving sheds with small charging sheds on their south-east side. A small hospital building stood in isolation at the centre of the site and to the south-east of this were the assembly sheds. To the south-east again, adjacent to the railway line, were the dispatching sheds and box store. Army Ordnance Department (A.O.D.) and other store buildings and magazines stood between Greensplot Farm (SMR 9230) and Washingpool Farm (SMR 9232) to the east of the site. The general offices, a larger hospital, inspection offices and a garage lay away from the main site, to the south of Greensplot Farm.\r\nIt is not currently clear what area of the site was used specifically for the production of mustard gas and how much for other munitions. The postwar use of the site is unknown but all of the factory buildings appear to have remained standing into the 1930s (SMR 21401; Neale 1976, 227) and most were still extant at the end of the Second World War. Two brick air raid shelters were constructed on the southern side of the dirty change house, probably in the late 1930s.  The group of structures close to Chittening Warth had been demolished by the beginning of December 1946 (CPE/UK/1869 Frame 4015; SMR 21402) with the exception of the laundry buildings and the chimney of the boiler house. The general offices and surrounding buildings, including the hospital, and most of the A.O.D. stores were also extant.\r\nAn archaeological desk-based assessment of the site of the changing sheds was carried out in 2004 (SMR 21992; Bryant 2004) and the surviving historic buildings in the core of the filling factory, including the dirty and clean change houses, a dispatch shed and an assembly shed were subsequently archaeologically recorded  in advance of their demolition (SMR 22114; Davis 2004).\r\nThere are photographs of buildings within the factory in the SMR Collection of Ground-based photographs."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The western part of the site formed part of the estate of William Reeves, who owned the copper foundry at Crew's Hole, from 1740. Reeves built Arno's Court House (SMR 8467), the Bath House (SMR 20124), Black Castle (SMR 3498) and the gateway (Ison 1952). Elements of the designed landscape park survive (including some mature trees, boundary walls and the remains of a prospect mounds).\r\nIn 1837 an Act of Parliament (1 Vict. Cap.cxxi) was obtained, enabling the creation of a cemetery company, the Bristol General Cemetery Company, and setting out the rules for its operation and for interment. It was to function as a private cemetery and was laid out following 1834 designs by James Loudon (Harding & Lambert 1994, 109). The entrance lodges, Church of England mortuary chapel (SMR 20122) and Nonconformist mortuary chapel (SMR 20123) were designed by Charles Underwood, a local architect. The cemetery opened in 1839 and in 1850 it was reported that the cemetery then covered a little over twenty-seven acres, of which more than eight acres was consecrated ground (Clark 1850, 220-224). Part of the cemetery was used for the interment of the remains of \"several hundred\" victims of the cholera epidemic of 1849 (Clark 1850, 220-224). A number of major figures were also interred at Arno's Vale in the nineteenth century. The remains of Raja Ram Mohum Roy Bahadoor (1772-1833), an Indian reform campaigner who died in Bristol, were interred in a tomb designed by the artist William Prinsep (1794-1874) in 1843. The educational reformer Mary Carpenter (1807-1877)  and the founder of the Muller orphanages, George Muller (1805-1898), were also buried there.The cemetery was enlarged by permission of Acts of Parliament in 1880 (43 and 44 Vict. Ch.lxxix) and 1891 (54 Vict. Ch.xi) which allowed the purchase of land adjoining the southern side of the cemetery, creating an area of approximately 45 acres in total. A further act in 1926 (16 and 17 Geo.5 Ch.vi) permitted the construction of a crematorium and an associated chapel. This was constructed in 1928 and was one of the earlier crematoriums in the country.\r\nThe cemetery was sold in the 1960s and again in the 1970s, and maintenance of the cemetery was not kept up. The cemetery and its management company was acquired by Mr. Tony Towner, a barrister, in 1987. Despite the change in ownership the level of investment in maintenance continued to be inadequate. The Company operated the cemetery until 31 March 1998 when it closed the site. The closure decision caused local people, through the Association for the Preservation of Arnos Vale Cemetery (which became the Friends of Arno's Vale Cemetery in 1998), to take direct action in order to maintain access to the cemetery. On Thursday 21 May 1998 the MP for the Bristol East constituency, Ms Jean Corston, secured an adjournment debate on the subject of the cemetery and in July 1988 a march and demonstration through Bristol City Centre was organised by the Friends of Arno's Vale. Bristol City Council resolved to acquire the cemetery in June 2000. A charitable trust, the Arno's Vale Cemetery Preservation Trust, was established by the Friends of Arno's Vale. The cemetery was subject to compulsory purchase by Bristol City Council in early August 2003 and was immediately leased to the Arno's Vale Cemetery Preservation Trust (Cloke & Jones 2004) for a period of 125 years. Funding of £4.82 million was granted to the Trust by the Heritage Lottery Fund in mid-December 2005 to support a long-term conservation programme.\r\nThe entrance gates, lodges, chapels, war memorial (SMR 20119) and several of the individual monuments are Listed Buildings, notably the tomb of the Indian reformer Raja Ram Mohun Roy Bahadoor (SMR 20120) which has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building No.901-1/47/438).

The statue was commissioned by the Bristol Corporation in 1731, after the buildings around the side of the square had been completed, to form the focal point of a proposed scheme of cross and diagonal gravel paths in the central green space. The commissioning of the statue was facilitated by John Elbridge (founder of a charity school at St. Michael's Hill (BUAD 933M)) and the Corporation ordered a payment of £500 to him on 25 August 1733. The following year the Society of Merchant Venturers paid Elbridge £300 towards the statue (Eustace 1982, 31-32).\r\nRysbrack produced the sculpture in his studio in London. The clay model for the statue was begun on 1 May 1733 (a small gilded model was also produced), and the statue had been cast in plaster by 1 August of that year. The brass casting was also executed in Rysbrack's studio and the statue was brought to Bristol by sea in July 1735. Despite the apparent success of the work, this appears to have been Rysbrack's only work in metal. On 25 September 1736 the mayor Lionel Lyde reported that the statue had been erected in the Square. However, an outstanding balance of £709 10s 3d remained to be paid. The Corporation undertook to pay £500 and the Society of Merchant Venturers contributed another £200 to Lyde \"towards finishing King Williams statue\" (quoted in Eustace 1982, 32-32).\r\nThe statue was set on a large ashlar pedestal of Portland stone with a moulded plinth and cornice and faced north, towards the Custom House. The works to landscape the square and lay out the gravel paths were then implemented (Hughes et al. 1996, 23). By 1749 the statue had apparently started to show faults and the Town Clerk was instructed to write to the sculptor to advise him of this. The Corporation ultimately resolved to carry out works \"to repair the Defects in the s[ai]d statue at the Expence of this House\" (quoted in Hughes et al. 1996, 24). At sometime between the rioting in the square in 1831 and 1880 the statue was enclosed with iron railings.\r\nIn the late 1930s the inner circuit road was pushed through the centre of Queen Square from Redcliffe Way.\r\nAfter restoration work the statue was placed on a small traffic island in the middle of the carriageway facing towards the Centre (Winstone 1987, pls.91-92) and it remained in this position until it was replaced on its original alignment as part of a scheme to restore the square implemented in 1999 (Merritt 2002, 16). The opportunity was taken to make a photogrammetric survey of the statue (BUAD 3498) and carry out conservation work. Samples of the metal were also analysed, which established its composition an alloy of copper and zinc, ie brass (Merritt 200216-17). Observation of the groundworks associated with the reconstruction of the plinth (BUAD 3515) noted a group of numerals carved on its north face. The inscription consisted of a group of three characters \"173\" and another, unfinished, character, apparently a \"4\", suggesting that the plinth may have been pre-fabricated and was assembled in the square (Etheridge 2000).\r\nThe statue has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/220)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building was constructed in the twelfth-century and was house with first floor hall. It was orientated from north-west to south-east (parallel to Broad Street) and the footprint of the building measured 13.3 metres from north-west to south-east and it was 7.1 metres wide. The building was constructed of Brandon Hill Grit and the walls were 1 metre thick at foundation level.\r\n\r\nAt lower level there was a V-shaped window embrasure in the end wall.\r\n\r\nThe foundations and end walls were constructed of Brandon Hill Grit, and exceeded 1 metre in thickness.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the south-west side wall had been rebuilt later in the medieval period.\r\n\r\nA view of the exterior from the north-east was drawn by O'Neill in 1820 (BRSMG M2375) shows Cyder House Passage running below the first-floor hall, with, above the passage, a 2-light window with cinquefoil heads under an overall square head with drip moulding, the bottom of the window blocked off. To the north of the passage, against the north-west end of the Norman building, lay a later structure, perhaps of seventeenth-century date. It comprised 2 storeys and attic, 1 gable to each external elevation, its north-west end built against the rear of the Court House in Tailors Court. Both elevations jettied. Entrance, with porch, in north-east wall at first-floor, cross-window to left of it 3-light window in gable; small window to attic storey at right-hand end. South-east elevation not clearly illustrated, but probably with first-floor cross-window, and 3-light window to gable. Structure leading to porch not drawn in detail, but arch shown below it. Some detail of the rear and end of Court House.\r\n\r\nRecorded internally by Rowbotham in 1828, with a view apparently towards the north-western end of the first-floor room or hall. This was open to the roof, one of at least 4, or possibly 5, bays; arch-braced trusses springing off corbels about two-thirds of the way up the side wall, the two corbels visible decorated with faces. Two tiers of plain windbraces; long, moulded, purlin or similar, above uppermost tier. Between 2nd. & 3rd. bays from south, as drawn, a partition to wall plate height, with a full-width carved beam above doorway height; 2 adjacent doorways, left to stairs down, right to stairs up. In first bay of north-east wall, window of at least 2 lights, cinquefoil heads, bottom of lights blocked. in next bay, a small square window above corbels. Floorboards running along length of building; to left, bottom of staircase with twisted newels at bottom.\r\n\r\nLater, the building was in use as a tavern. It appears to have been the Lord Raglan tavern, gutted by fire in the early hours of Tuesday 4 January 1859. The Bristol Mercury newspaper for 8 January 1859 reported \"At about a quarter past three o'clock on Tuesday morning a fire was discovered to have broken out in the Lord Raglan tavern, Cider-house passage, Broad-street.\" and that \"The building being very old, and composed for the most part of wood, the fire spread with rapidity, and the part of the house used as a singing-room, and known as the Lord Raglan Concert-hall, together with the brew-house underneath, was soon wrapped in flames...\" Such concert halls or rooms were the forerunners of the music hall.\r\n\r\nThe south-east gable end remained intact, as did part of the south-west wall until 1990. The house was demolished in early 1990. The north-west gable end survives incorporated into the rear wall of the late-seventeenth century Court House, and was drawn in about 1992.

The Society of Merchant Venturers was established by an Ordinance of the Bristol Corporation in 1467 and was confirmed by subsequent Royal charters. The site was acquired by the Society in the mid-sixteenth century after the Guild of Mariners which had founded a chantry chapel dedicated to St. Clement (BUAD 1206M) there. The chapel building was converted into use as the Society's meeting hall. A vignette in the border of James Millerd's 1673 plan of Bristol shows the hall in its original form, with the Society's coat of arms fixed to the wall above the main entrance door. The internal plan of the hall during the seventeenth century is not clear, but an inventory of its contents in December 1631 refers to the hall and inner rooms (McGrath 1952, 68-70).\r\nIn 1718 the Society resolved to create new rooms and land on the north side of the existing hall was purchased for an extension. In 1719 a new \"Great Room \" and a \"Withdrawing Room\" were completed. The Society expended a further £1000 in works to the building between 1720 and 1722, including an improved entrance, probably refronting of the King Street elevation and an extension on the north side. The architect Thomas Paty was employed in 1787 to remodel the exterior of the building, a process which seems to have taken a number of years. After Paty's redesign was completed, the building had six bays and two storeys. The lower storey had six casement windows with architrave surrounds. The upper storey had six tall sash windows, with the date \"1701\" between the heads of the third and fourth windows, and the cornice had six sunken panels. The parapet had square corner pillars. The centre of the west elevation steps forward slightly and like the south elevation, had rusticated quoins at the corners. The entrance was at first floor level and was reached by steps with decorative railings. This had a column on either side and a porch, and above the entrance was an arched niche containing a bust on a plinth. A low wall with railings surrounded the precinct. In the nineteenth century a number of internal alterations were made to the building to improve its facilities, including refurnishing in 1838, installation of a heating system - the \"warm air apparatus\" designed by a Mr H. C. Price - in 1842-1843 and a new decorative scheme designed by the architect Owen Jones (McGrath 1975, 269-270).\r\nThe hall was used for entertaining and events by other local organisations and groups on a number of occasions, notably on 10 June 1921 when Edward Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) was made a Freeman of the Society of Merchant Venturers at a ceremony there.\r\nThe building was extensively damaged by bombing on 2 December 1940 and as a result the Society's furniture, plate and records were removed to secure storage. Air raids struck the hall again on 16 March 1941 and then on 14 May (Warne 1943, 20), this time causing irrecoverable damage to the remaining elements of the structure (McGrath 1975, 459-461). It remained derelict for several years after the war while the Society considered whether to rebuild the hall. Finally, in 1955, the site was sold and it was subsequently redeveloped."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

An inn known as the \"Starrs\" or the \"Seven Stars,\" on or close to the site of the present building, appears to have existed in Thomas Lane by the 1670s. In 1671 an annuity of 30 shillings was granted to the Feoffees of St. Thomas by Richard Pope on the issues of the house known by the sign of the \"Starrs,\" adjacent to St. Thomas Church. Of the annuity, 10 shillings was to be used for an annual sermon on the Sunday after All Saints Day and 20 shillings was to be distributed on the same day among poor parishioners who did not receive weekly alms.\r\nThe present building is believed to have been constructed in the second half of the eighteenth century and is a rendered building of two-storeys, attic and cellar with a pantile mansard roof.

A pantiled pentice roof which runs the full width of Nos.7 and 8 divides the ground from the first floor. The fenestration at first floor consists of a single, central canted bay. A similar pentice divides the first and second, and the second and attic storeys, again with a canted bay at second floor. Above the small attic window there is a pantiled pentice across its width. The building was partly refenestrated in the eighteenth-century.\r\nRestoration between 1967 and 1976, when it and No.8 formed the offices of Moxley, Jenner and Partners, architects, revealed the reuse of ship's timbers as structural elements within the building. Some laths were also found to be reused barrel staves.\r\nThe building has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/599)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The fort was constructed in 1642 as part of the new northern line of defences around Bristol to protect the city during the English Civil Wars. It was probably built of stone and was apparently square, the Royalist engineer Sir Bernard de Gomme describing it as \"fower square, ech side 24 of my passes\" [probably around 20 metres] (Firth 1925, 184). The structure seems to have consisted of a high level platform with gun embrasures and internal rooms below. A survey of the ordnance captured at the storming of Bristol made on 28 July 1643 records that there were three sakers and one \"murderer\" at the fort (Roy 1975, 261).\r\nIn 1643 fighting around Prior's Hill fort appears to have been relatively limited. There was some exchange of fire on the night of 24 July and the Royalist assault during the following morning included with small attacks on the defensive line to either side of the fort (Firth 1925, 187; 189). The Royalists presumably refortified the structure as part of other strengthening works to the line after their capture of the city but little is currently (17/06/2002) known about the nature of these works although Sprigge's account of the Parliamentarian assault of late-August and early-September 1645 refers to a sally-port near Prior's Hill fort, possibly to the east (Sprigge 1854, 104; 105-106).\r\nThe fort was a focus of fighting during the Parliamentarian assault on Bristol. The fort was subjected to a bombardment on 4 September. During the storming of the city in the early morning of the 10 September the Kingsdown section of the defensive line was heavily assaulted and was entered by the Parliamentarian regiments commanded by Colonel Rainsborough and Colonel Hammond. According to Sprigge Prior's Hill fort \"very obstinately held out, playing fiercely with great and small shot upon our men for two hours after the line was entered\" (Sprigge 1854, 117). The Parliamentarian forces eventually managed to reach the fort and get over the palisades protecting it using ladders. After hand-to-hand fighting they seized the colours and forced the defenders into the inner rooms where, according to Sprigge, \"our soldiers were so little prepared for to show mercy, by the opposition that they met withal in the storm, and the refusal of quarter when it was offered, that they put to the sword the commander, . and almost all the officers, soldiers, and others in the fort, except a very few, which at the entreaty of some our officers, had their lives spared\" (Sprigge 1854, 117).\r\nSprigge reports that following the Parliamentarian capture of the city Cromwell ordered that the forts along the line be left \"in a safe condition\", presumably by partial demolition (Sprigge 1854, 132). The fort had been entirely demolished by the early 1740s and its site is not indicated by Jean Rocque's 1742 map of Bristol which suggests that the area had returned to largely agricultural use by that date.

Glynne also noted the shaft of the cross in the churchyard (McGarvie 1994, 49-50). A watercolour by John Buckler executed in 1828 in the Piggott collection records the church from the south-east. The church is constructed of coursed red and grey Pennant sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings and stone-coped slate roofs. The eastern end was rebuilt in 1874 by B. Ferrey.\r\nThe interior dates predominantly to the late-nineteenth century with a fifteenth-century archway.\r\nThe building has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building Number 901-1/49/452)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The wall was constructed in the thirteenth century and ran from a terminal tower, Tower Harratz (BUAD 671M), at Temple Back across Temple Meads and along Portwall Lane to Redcliff Back. There were a number of interval towers or bastions along the length of the wall, and there was a water gate (BUAD 1418M), close to Tower Harratz. The wall was also pierced by gates for vehicular traffic at the southern ends of Temple Street (Temple Gate - BUAD 927M) and Redcliff Street (Redcliff Gate - BUAD 1211M).\r\nThe wall has been recorded during archaeological excavation in several locations. It was constructed in Pennant sandstone bonded in a light-brown sandy mortar and measured 2 metres wide. Its foundations extended several metres into the underlying alluvial clay but none of the excavations has so far found any evidence for supporting piles. In front of the wall was a berm which was approximately 15 metres wide. Beyond this was a substantial ditch, known as Portwall ditch which was around 15 metres wide and up to 5 metres deep (BUAD 312; 408).\r\nThe wall was altered and reinforced during the English Civil Wars of the 1640s and the excavations of the Portwall ditch (BUAD 312; 408) also found evidence for recutting of the ditch, probably associated with the refortification of the wall during the 1640s. A survey of 1643 records cannon at Tower Harratz, Temple Gate and the adjacent tower and at Redcliff Gate (Roy 1975, 261-263). Assaults were made on the Portwall by Royalist forces in 1643 and by the New Model Army in 1645. The wall was not breached and after the wars appears to have remained largely extant - it was recorded by James Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol - and the reputation of its strength was a causal factor in encouraging the Monmouth rebels not to attack the south side of Bristol in the mid-1680s.\r\nThe Portwall appears to have remained standing into the post-medieval period and been gradually incorporated into other structures. No part of the wall now survives above ground but it is known to be extant for considerable stretches along its length. During excavation and evaluation in several places the wall has been located close to the ground surface. The eastern half of the Portwall was retained in situ in the Temple Quay development and a scheme of paving and lighting to mark its line was designed by the Irish artist John Aiken."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The precinct may have been defined by Temple Street and the later-named Pipe Lane, Rose Street and Prince Eugene Lane. Little is currently known about the arrangement and form of the monastic buildings on the site, but it appears that they may not have been particularly extensive. An inventory made for dissolution of the house refers to the vestry, hall and kitchen.\r\nThe friary was dissolved on 10 September 1538 (Gairdner 1893, 125). The site was purchased by Maurice Dennys for £536 14s. in March 1544 (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 174-175). Dennys immediately sold the site on to John Perte (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 178)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building was aligned parallel with the street and measured approximately 23 metres from north-west to south-east and was 5.5 metres wide, with a garden plot to the rear.\r\nFrom the Reformation the vestry of St. Mary Redcliffe managed the almshouse. The building is reported to have been rebuilt by the vestry in 1675 at a cost of £113 (Manchee 1831, 58) and on October 1700 the vestry appears to have entered into an agreement with the newly-created Corporation of the Poor. An inspection by officers of the Corporation in April 1705 found that \"it was inhabited by rude disorderly people\" (Manchee 1831, 57). The vestry continued to nominate poor parishioners to reside in the almshouse and to maintain the building, while the Corporation of the Poor provided an annual sum of £16 to the residents. In 1831 there were fourteen residents (Manchee 1831, 57)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The tower was in existence by the time of the perambulation of the county of Bristol in 1373 in which it is named as \"Tourharatz.\" It was a circular tower built of Pennant sandstone bonded in a mid-brown mortar and measuring 13 metres in diameter at foundation level. The tower was constructed around a core of clay, 5.4 metres across, with six clay spines (each roughly 1.6 metres wide) radiating from the centre (Jackson 1995). This core appeared to have been formed by cutting of the natural clay rather than by dumping of material on the site. The form of the tower above ground level is not clear.\r\nThe tower was still standing at the time of the English Civil War, when three cannon - 1 Saker and 2 Minions - were positioned on the tower (Roy 1975, 262). By the time of James Millerd's map of 1673 small scale development was taking place to the north, between the tower and river; archaeological excavation exposed a path around the tower which led to a slipway to the inside the line of the town wall, and Millerd shows tenements abutting it. The tower was still standing in 1695, when it was referred to in the lease for an adjacent property (BRO ETD 00020) and is believed to have been demolished in the eighteenth century when the Portwall was incorporated piecemeal into new building (Cox 1998). Seyer reports that parts of the tower remained in the 1820s but that these were in use elements of other buildings (Seyer 1823, 52). Probably during the later nineteenth century the remains of the tower were demolished to foundation level and buried beneath several metres of made ground.\r\nThe clay core was damaged by the excavation of a geotechnical trial pit through the centre of it in the early 1980s. This trial pit was archaeologically observed but no stonework was visible and the position of the tower was not confirmed until an archaeological field evaluation in 1994 (BUAD 462). The area of the tower was subject to archaeological excavation (BUAD 463), exposing the full plan of the structure. The site was redeveloped in 1998-1999 as a new office building for Bristol and West Building Society but the remains of the tower were retained beneath a courtyard within the new building (Jackson, 1994; Williams 1994-95, 74).

The new owners invested in the business, installing additional boilers and charcoal filters.\r\nThe process by which the sugar was refined was described in an article published in the Bristol Times and Mirror and reprinted in 1883 (Anon, 1883). The entrance to the works was on Queen Street and the raw sugar was bought into the first floor melting room, on the north side of the works by Queen Street bridge, where it was dissolved in water and boiled in \"blow up\" pans. The syrup was then released through a pipe into the room below where it was cleaned and decoloured through charcoal filters. The syrup was then pumped into vacuum pans for further heating and then cooled and the various grades of sugar crystals produced by spinning in centrifuges at 800 rpm. The site is now occupied by an office block built in the 1980s which is semi-basemented in part.

Demolition of the building to make way for a warehouse began on 9 February 1904 (Pritchard 1906, 129) and some of the brackets on the front of the building were given to the City Museum by the builders Messrs. Wilkins and Sons (BUAD 996A). The building was painted by T. L. Rowbotham in 1825 (BRSMG M2800) and there is also a photograph of it dating to the 1890s (Winstone 1960, pl.53)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The guild was an association of secular clergy and laity constituted with the purpose of meeting on the first day of the month to celebrate mass and intercede on behalf of the living and for the souls of the dead. The Bristol Kalendars were one of only a handful of similar guilds in the country, the others being at Exeter and Winchester. Its origins are obscure (Neale 2000, 210-211), but it had apparently been established by the early-thirteenth century (Orme 1978, 35).\r\nThe house at All Saints seems to have been built in the fourteenth century and oversailed the north aisle of All Saint's Church. Little is currently known in detail about its medieval form. The guild was wealthy enough to maintain a prior and three chantry priests in the building, and in the mid-fifteenth century created a public theological library there. The initiative seems to have come from the Bishop of Worcester with the aim of creating a centre of religious orthodoxy to counter the influence of Lollardy, and the library was open for private study for four hours each weekday (Orme 1978, 40-43). A deed of 1548 suggests that the library was housed in an extension to the main building, recording that the building had \"a chamber annexed ... vulgarly called the Librarye\" (Leech 1997, 66).\r\nThe Guild of Kalendars was dissolved at Easter 1548 and unlike many other medieval guilds it did not reconstitute itself but instead ceased to exist and the Crown sold off its property (Orme 1978, 45). The house seems to have been bought by Miles Partridge and Hugh Partridge and was immediately leased by them to Robert Wudwarde (Leech 1997, 66). The site had passed into the ownership of All Saints parish by 1616 when a faculty was granted for the creation of a doorway through the north wall of the church (Leech 1997, 66-67).\r\nJames Millerd's 1673 prospect of Bristol includes a vignette which shows All Saint's Church, and this records the building as a sixteenth- or seventeenth-century house of three storeys and attics with a cross-gabled roof, presenting two gables to Corn Street. There was a possible stair turret at the east end of the north elevation. There were mullioned windows on all floors. All Saints Conduit (BUAD 682M) was built into the ground-floor. By the early eighteenth century the building had apparently become the coffee house of George Cooke and on the basis of the property records Leech suggests that the house may have been rebuilt in c.1740 by John Worrall, though how extensive the rebuilding was is unknown. Extensive rebuilding did, however, take place when the present No.56 Corn Street (BUAD 336M) was constructed in 1782, but elements of earlier fabric appear to have survived in the cellar and the south wall of the property."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

A survey of the ordnance captured at the storming of Bristol made on 28 July 1643 records that there was one minion and one falcon at the fort (Roy 1975, 261). Although the fort was involved in the fighting during both major assaults on the Bristol, attacks were concentrated elsewhere on the line, particularly towards Prior's Hill Fort (BUAD 121M).\r\nSprigge reports that following the Parliamentarian capture of the city Cromwell ordered that the forts along the line be left \"in a safe condition\", presumably by partial demolition (Sprigge 1854, 132).

The remains of the fort were also noted to be extant in 1751 (BRO P/StJ/ChW/6). The antiquary Samuel Seyer observed the remains of the fort in the early-nineteenth century, noting that much had been cut away by the road, while the remainder survived in a garden (Seyer 1823, 305).

The church was built by the Knights Hospitallers, beginning c.1400 with the nave being completed by 1500. The land to the south and east of the church became the churchyard.\r\nThe church was constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble with Bath stone ashlar dressings and is in a Perpendicular Gothic style. It has an aisled nave (without a clerestorey), and a chancel with five bays containing chapels. At the west end of the south aisle there is a five-stage Somerset-type tower at the south corner of the west end which stands 34.75 metres high. The tower was begun in 1441 and was completed in 1460. Subsidence caused the lower two stages of the tower to lean to the west before the third stage was added. The upper stages were built on an angle to try to correct the structural forces, but the tower then moved again. The pinnacles were consequently never added to the tower.\r\nInternally with chapels of four (smaller) bays to north and south. The chapels included St. Katherine's Chapel, founded by the Weavers' Fraternity in the late-fourteenth century, as well as altars dedicated to the Holy Trinity, SS Andrew and Nicholas and St. James (Wadley 1886, passim). There was also a chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary outside the church (Wadley 1886, 29; 55).\r\nThe Knights Hospitallers were suppressed in 1540 and the church was acquired by the Bristol Corporation in July of that year as part of its purchase of Temple Fee from the Crown (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 626). The chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary was demolished in the sixteenth-century.\r\nA porch with Corinthian pilasters to a segmental pediment with a cartouche inside and an urn on the top was added to the nave in the mid-eighteenth century. The interior was also refitted in the eighteenth-century. In June 1788 the vicar, Rev. Joseph Easterbrook, along with six other ministers, performed a controversial exorcism in the vestry on George Lukins, a tailor from Yatton who claimed to be possessed by demons (Anon., 1788; Easterbrook, 1788). Restoration works were undertaken in 1872, 1907 and 1911.\r\nAn organ was built by Harris in 1701 (although it is not clear whether this was Renatus Harris or John Harris). It was refurbished by John Smith junior of the Bristol organ builders John Smith and Sons in 1847.\r\nThe churchyard was closed to burials in the 1850s and was converted into a public park between 1878 and 1880.\r\nThe church was gutted as a result of bombing on the night of the 24th and 25 November 1940 and only the shell walls now remain.\r\nA survey of the building was undertaken by Wessex Archaeology in 1999 (BUAD 3775; Taylor 2000).\r\nThe church is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (SAM No. AV28841) and is an English Heritage Guardianship Monument. The building has Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/42/337). The archway and gates leading to the church are separately listed Grade II (Listed Building number 901-1/42/336)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Arrivals and Departures were on opposite sides, passengers passing through the undercroft, which held the waiting rooms. The engines were turned on turntables and moved from line to line in the engine shed. The functional space of the station as designed by Brunel is almost entirely intact.

A decision was taken by the Gloucestershire Commissioners to develop a new prison close to the site of the old bridewell in October 1783. The prison, on the south side of Lawford's Gate, was built in the late 1780s to a design by William Blackburn. Blackburn was replaced as architect during the course of construction by William Hobson.\r\nThe prisoners were transferred to the new building on 1 June 1791. In its finished form the house of correction was of two storeys and was constructed of rubble stone with a slate roof. A central, octagonal element contained the chapel at ground floor with the infirmary and dark (punishment) cells on either side at first-floor level. There twenty cells on each floor and these were arranged in two wings off the octagonal core. Each floor of each wing had a central corridor with five cells on either side of it. The cells all measured 7 feet 4 inches (2.24 metres) by 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 metres). Within the prison there was also a petty sessions room approximately 6 metres square and a two room keeper's house (each room of which was 3.6 metres square), plus a wash-house (Whiting 1975, 138-141). According to a late eighteenth-century report quoted by Whiting (1975, 141) there were on average between ten and twelve prisoners who were emploed cutting logs, making shoemakers pegs or making shoes. By 1832 the work given to the prisoners was picking oakum. The prisoners used the one yard and one day-room where they could fraternise and receive visitors.\r\nIn the nineteenth century an extension was added to the south-east side of the prison.\r\nThe building remained in use until 1860 but stood empty after that date until its demolition in 1907."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building is a timber-framed single-bay house of three storeys and attic with a rendered façade. It is of late seventeenth-or early eighteenth-century date and appears to have been built as the western of a pair with No.14 West Street. The building was probably constructed with a gabled roof. A surviving passage, paved with Pennant Sandstone flags, served both buildings leading from West Street to the rear of the property. The entrance door to the upper floors was off this passage.\r\nThe building was constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble bonded in a red sandy mortar with white lime inclusions. These walls are extant in the rear two thirds of the structure. The rear elevation, however, has seen a number of phases of alteration.\r\nThe upper floors oversail the passage, supported by several large oak beams and structural beams survive at all levels within the building. The internal plan has been significantly altered over time and the original organisation of the internal spaces has not yet been established. However, particularly at ground-floor the beams show evidence of mortices where internal timber partitions are likely to have been removed.\r\nBoth buildings were refronted in the nineteenth century. The ground-floor is currently occupied by a shopfront with a central entrance doorway. There are three doors in the eastern wall of No.12 West Street and the main entrance to the property is the first, northern, of these. This opens into a narrow stairwell with a moulded timber jamb on its western side. This was inserted into the building in the eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century and was an octagonal brick structure. Above the ground floor the party wall with No.14 West Street appears to have been reconstructed at a similar date. Timbers were nailed to the knees of the cross timbers to extend across the shared passage and is the timber framed party wall above rests on these extensions.\r\nInternally no original fittings or features are known to survive, apart from a possible alcove for a cupboard in the western party wall at second floor. A number of historic timbers are extant in the ceilings, however. The roof and part of the parapet was replaced in the late-nineteenth or early-twentieth century.\r\nAt the rear, southern, end of the passage there was probably a detached kitchen constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble. Much of the shell of this appears to survive but part of the eastern and northern wall have been removed, and the original roof replaced with a lean-to pantile roof at a lower level.\r\nThe building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/12/1661)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building occupied the south-east corner of the St. Nicholas Parish extension burial ground in Crow Lane [BUAD 43M]. A dwelling stood on the site from 1422 when a rent for it is known to have been paid to the merchant Richard Trenode. By 1579 it was occupied by Welthian Betts, a widow, when it was on the north side of a lane leading to Baste Street [modern Queen Charlotte Street] (Leech, 1997 168-169). The building is recorded by early-nineteenth century watercolours in the Braikenridge Collection of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, notably that by T. L. S. Rowbotham made in 1825 (BRSMG M2238) which shows the east-facing elevation on Welsh Back and part of the north-facing elevation, and another by Hugh O'Neill of 1823 (BRSMG M2279) also showing the north-facing and the west-facing elevation.\r\nThese show a gabled two-bay house of two storeys plus attic with a pantile roof. It was of sixteenth- or seventeenth-century date. Its footprint measured 6.25 metres north-south and 13.3 metres from east to west. The main, east-facing, elevation fronted on to Welsh Back and the ground floor was a shopfront with the main doorway at the north end of the elevation. The fenestration to the south of the doorway consisted of a pair of three-by-four light with a stall riser beneath. There were signboards above both the door and the windows. The first and attic storeys were divided by a moulded string course and the fenestration of both storeys consisted of cross-windows. There was a small window near the apex of the gable. A tall chimney stack projected around a further storey above the eaves from the south wall of the building. At the centre of the north elevation there was a single window at ground, and at first-floor one at the centre of the elevation and one at the western end, the latter beneath a gablet. There were small two-light mullioned windows at the centre of the rear, west-facing, elevation and, immediately to the north, a projecting single-flue chimney stack. In the north side of the roof there was a skylight.\r\nIn 1850 the building was occupied by Frederick Willis when it was known as The Cardiff Boat (BRO Plan Book C fo.98a). It appears to have survived until the end of the nineteenth century and was recorded by the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 scale plan (Bristol Sheet LXXV.4.5) surveyed in 1882.

The building also housed Stokes Croft Endowed School. The charity was founded in 1722 by public subscription. In 1726 Joseph Houlton and Abraham Hook conveyed to the charity's trustees \"and to Richard Hort, since deceased, a certain piece of building, with the appurtenances, then used as to some parts thereof, as a charity school, and as to others parts thereof as an almshouse\" (Manchee 1831, 202). The intention was apparently to provide financial support and education for thirty boys.\r\nThe building consisted of a range of two- to three-storeys at the eastern side of the site with two wings, each of three storeys, running along the northern and southern sides towards Stokes Croft to create a central courtyard. The central range had a central entrance above a double curved stairway (forming a horseshoe), with large pedimented sashes on either side. The three sashes above these were plain. There were also cellar lights on either side of the entrance steps. The wings constituted the almshouse while the school occupied the ground floor of the central range. The upper floor was the master's house. The wings were divided into individual almshouses, three on each floor. There was one continuous roof, hipped at its ends to Stokes Croft.\r\nLatterly the school and almshouse were run by the Lewin's Mead Unitarian Church. By the late 1820s the financial resources of the school had reduced to a level sufficient to support only one boy, and at that date there were eleven women and one man resident in the almshouse (Manchee 1831, 203-204). The building appears to have been rebuilt, or refaced, in the late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century. It survived into the twentieth century but was destroyed by bombing on 24 November 1940."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

No.34 King Street seems to have been constructed as a warehouse for No.33 King Street (BUAD 111M) and its footprint extended originally some 4.6 metres north from the street frontage. The warehouse was presumably part of the property associated with No.33 King Street until the later nineteenth century. No.33 King Street had been constructed by 1658.

The cross was erected in 1373, according to local tradition, (apparently as a replacement for an earlier cross) to celebrate the acquisition of county status and, according to Adams's Chronicle, was repainted and gilded in 1490 and again in 1573. In May 1633 the cross was remodelled, work finishing in December 1634. The Common Council was petitioned in 1733 by people living in the area who demanded its removal, arguing that:\r\n\"It hath been insinuated by some that this Cross, on account of its antiquity ought to be lookt upon as something sacred; But when we consider that we are protestants, and that popery ought effectually to be garded against in this Nation, we make this our request to you to consider. If the opening of a passage to four of the principal streets in this City ought not to outweigh anything that can be said for the keeping up a ruinous and superstitious Relick, which is at present a public nuisance\" (quoted in Liversidge 1978 2).\r\nThe removal of the cross was ordered, though the stones were stored by the Corporation. In 1736, after the intervention of Alderman Price the cross was re-erected on College Green (at NGR ST 58349 72772).\r\nA proposal to remove the cross from College Green was made in 1757 by a contractor working on the improvement of the paths on College Green, but the monument was not dismantled until August 1762. After a period in storage in the Cathedral it was given to Henry Hoare by the Dean and removed, in August 1766, to Stourhead where it now stands. Hoare considered that \"the legs are not worth fetching\" (Pryce 1861 559) andduring its re-erection the original base was replaced with a solid structure.\r\nOn the base rests a second stage on which four monarchs are depicted. Originally King John faced north (into Broad Street), Henry II faced east (into Wine Street), Edward III, a later addition according to Ponting, faced south (into High Street). The upper stages were added in 1633, and included four Tudor and Stuart monarchs, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, James I and Charles I. At the top, was a spirelet which supported a copper cross. The whole structure stood 48 feet high according to Ponting who measured the cross at Stourhead. The stone used was an oolitic limestone, probably from Dundry or Bath. Liversidge argues that the lower tiers are of early fifteenth-century date (Liversidge 1978 11).\r\nA replica of the cross (BUAD 40M), made in 1851 by John Norton, is located in Berkeley Square."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The factory was gutted by a fire so that, according to the Bristol Mirror of 27th July 1811, \"in little more than an hour nothing more than bare walls were left standing\" but was soon operating again. In 1817 Ring's partnership with Cookworthy was dissolved and Ring took over the running of the factory alone until his death in August 1818. The business and premises were auctioned and may have been bought by a William Bissix (Price et al., 1984 267). The business was taken on by John Ring's elder brother Richard Frank Ring who built a factory - the Ohio Tobacco-Pipe Manufactory - on the north side of Commercial Road at Temple Back which exported pipes to the Caribbean, the east coast of the United States, Canada and Ireland. By 1861 the business had become Richard Charles Ring & Co. although its interests diversified considerably and by 1884 the factory had apparently been sold to Hawley & Co.

The building was constructed in the mid-1660s apparently as the eastern of a group of three, the lease for the plots of Nos.16-18 being granted by the Bristol Corporation to Francis Bayley, a shipwright, in 1663 (BRO 04335(5) fo.4). This lease set a limit of three years for construction, suggesting that the three buildings had probably been completed by 1666.\r\nThe building is a single-bay, three-storey timber-framed house with a gabled roof. In its original form the plan of the building at ground-floor consisted of two principal rooms which were separated by a half-turn stair placed between them. The stair had square newel posts with ball finials, turned pendants and balusters and a moulded handrail, all of pine. The stair is extant at first-floor level and above. Access to the rear part of the building was through the passage on the eastern side and the architectural evidence suggests that the rear room probably occupied the fill-width of the building. This has a large chimneybreast in the west wall, suggesting that the room was originally the kitchen. The plan of the upper floors was similarly arranged, with two principal rooms, front and rear separated by the stair and landing on the east side and a closet on the west. Both principal rooms occupied the full width of the building. The roof is of principal rafter and butt purlin construction using pine and was originally of five bays.\r\nAt the south end of the plot, fronting on to Little King Street, a warehouse building (BUAD 1437M) was constructed in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth-century. This was of three storeys with hipped pantile roof. The structure was probably linked to the rear of the main house by a gallery at first-floor level.\r\nBy 1676 the house was leased by Thomas Barns of Landavenny, Monmouthshire. In 1703 it was in the hands of Thomas Branch, and had passed to John Aust, hooper, by 1724 (Leech 2001).\r\nThe main house was subject to some internal reorganisation in the early-eighteenth century when the half-turn stair at ground floor level was replaced with a straight stair to allow the two principal ground-floor rooms to be used as a single space. A partition was inserted to extend the side passage to the rear of the building at the same time and a window was inserted in the west wall of the stair at second floor to light the adjacent closet. By 1784 the building had been leased to John Rawson.\r\nThe building appears to have been significantly altered once more in the mid twentieth century, reportedly as the result of bomb damage. The King Street elevation was rebuilt and the northern bay of the roof was replaced with a flat roof during the twentieth century. The rear elevation of the building, including the rear gable of the roof, also seems to have been reconstructed at this time. The walls of the warehouse were re-constructed in brick at this time, although three seventeenth-century cross beams at ground floor and the central cross beam at first-floor were retained, as was the roof the timber of which are of late seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century date.\r\nThe building was surveyed by Dr. Roger Leech in 2001 (BUAD 3812; Leech 2001) and the report on this work also summarised the documentary history of the building. The original core of the main building appears to survive largely intact and several mid seventeenth-century features survive within the building, including the joists and boards of the cellar and a samson post located towards King Street, ovolo-moulded cross beams and doorcases at all floors, as well as several surviving elements of moulded plaster cornices. Much of the fabric of the roof also dates to the original construction of the house.\r\nThe house has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/601)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The burial ground was created in 1804 and was named in the 1805 Land Tax returns for St. Paul's parish as \"Weetch & Ward's Buring G[roun]d.\" A lease of 1808 refers to Weetch but also names Thomas Howland of Stapleton, a house carpenter who later lived at No.10 Wilson Street as the second party (Bryant 1999). The burial ground was measured around 35.5 metres from north to south and was 10 metres wide. It was described in 1850 as \"in a dirty state. It is surrounded, on two sides, by houses, is crossed by a path, and is a common receptacle for filth and rubbish\" (Clark 1850, 164). The burial register and other documentation relating to the cemetery is held in Bristol Record Office (BRO 11930(1-3)). A total of 1339 individuals were interred there, arranged in ten rows, A-E and AA-EE, with up to twenty plots to a row. Numbers buried in an individual plot varied between one and seventeen. Interment in the burial ground was ended by an Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852.\r\nBy the time of the first edition 1:500-scale Ordnance Survey Town plan (Bristol Sheet LXXII.13.11) the burial ground had been turned into gardens.

During the middle ages the site belonged to the Hospital of St. John the Baptist and was known as Redrock Garden. A hermitage was established at the south end of the garden (BUAD 627M). The hospital was dissolved in March 1544 and its lands were surrendered to the Crown. The site, and much of the associated property, was sold to Dr. George Owen, physician to Henry VIII and a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford. In 1665 the freehold of the site was acquired by the Society of Friends and a burial ground was established. By the nineteenth century the burial ground was set out in rows with stone markers for each. An Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852 imposed the restriction that \"only one body [was] to be buried in each grave\" on the burial ground.\r\nIn the later-nineteenth or early-twentieth century a uniform series of markers was created, each of sawn slate approximately 100 millimetres thick with a name carved into the face. The burial ground continued to be used until 1923. In 1927 the \"gravestones were removed and placed behind a fence in front of the Hermit's Cell\" (WRO 1699(28A) quoted in Stock 1996, 6).\r\nThe north end of the burial ground, including the entrance gate at that end, was lost when the inner circuit road was created in the late 1930s.

The culvert is 3 metres wide and a maximum of 2.5 metres high (estimated). The arch of the culvert springs from different levels, with the base of the arch being approximately 0.3 metres lower on the south side than on the north. The floor of the culvert is concave and appears to be constructed of Pennant Sandstone at the edges and brick in the centre, although this is not confirmed as the floor of the culvert is covered with several centimetres of sediment. Overall the section of culvert available for inspection follows a sinuous course, curving slightly north and then turning southward again.\r\nAt the east end of the culvert excavation work, probably undertaken in the 1970s and associated with the construction of the car park, had broken through the arch of the culvert.

Wolfe occupied this property in 1589 and carried out alterations to it including \"the rearinge up higher\" (BRO 04421(a) quoted in Leech 1997, 172). He renewed his lease in 1598 and this allowed him \"to Newe buylde the said Tenemente and everye parte thereof with thappurtenances within fowre yearees nexte ensuinge the date hereof...\" (quoted in Pilkington 1983, 14). The records of lawsuits in the Public Record Office (Pilkinton 1988) suggest that the theatre was in use by late 1604 or early 1605 and remained a playhouse until 1625, despite Wolfe's death in 1614. It appears that part of the building remained in domestic use, with some players staying there while performing in the city. The rooms were also let to \"comedyantes\". Under the terms of Wolfe's will annuities were granted to six Bristol charities out of the profits of the venture \"for longe only as the same house shall continewe a playe house...\" (quoted in Pilkinton 1988, 73).

A line of defences around the north side of Bristol was constructed in 1642 to defend the city when it declared its support for Parliament. The form of the original line is certain but it probably comprised a stone wall with a ditch in front. The precise line of the defences is largely still to be established. However, it ran from a Water Fort (BUAD 1043M) close to the River Avon at the foot of Brandon Hill, north across Brandon Hill to a fort at the summit of the hill. The line then passed north-west to the Windmill Fort in the area of modern Tyndall Avenue. From there it ran to Colston's Fort (BUAD 943M) on the north-west side of modern Montague Place, then to Prior's Hill Fort (BUAD 121M) near Fremantle Square (with Back of Kingsdown Parade likely to follow the line of the ditch). The line then turned downhill to Stokes Croft which was barricaded by a wooden gate (still extant in the 1740s). On the east side of the gate there was a small bastion or hornwork. The line then ran south-east toward the river Frome, passing though the area of Portland Square to a cannon position on Newfoundland Road.\r\nAfter Bristol was captured by Royalist forces in 1643 the line was subject to significant works to enhance its strength. The Windmill Fort was rebuilt and renamed The Royal Fort and there also appears to have been some movement of the line of the defences on Brandon Hill.\r\nAfter the Civil War the line appears to have been removed relatively quickly.

The square was laid out between 1788 and 1790 as a speculative housing development. The architect and developer, Daniel Hague, advertised for builders to take up the plots, in a newspaper advertisement of 24 March 1790 (Ison 1952, 220).  The parish of St. James's was divided to create the new parish of St. Paul and the church was built between 1789-1794 to a design by Hague. Construction of the houses stopped in 1793 as a result of the crash caused by the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. The houses were completed gradually during the second decade of the nineteenth century.\r\nLambert suggests it is likely that the central garden was an integral part of Hague's design. An obelisk was erected in the centre in 1810 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of George III's reign. This was replaced in the following year by a Coade Stone statue of the monarch, which was itself pulled down and damaged beyond repair by republicans on the night of the 23 March 1817 (Ison 1952, 223).\r\nCartographic evidence records varying layouts within the garden. Plumley and Ashmead's 1828 plan shows a perimeter walk divided from the railings by shrubs, with a central small bed and two elliptical, roughly symmetrical beds north and south.\r\nThe Ordnance Survey 1:500 plan surveyed in 1883 (Bristol Sheet LXXII.13.11) also shows a perimeter walk with shrubs and trees outside it, the central bed. The two ellipses had become less compact but are still identifiable; in addition several single trees stand in the open lawn.\r\nThe garden was conveyed to the Corporation on 12 September 1952, and in the following year bushes and undergrowth were cleared, trees removed and five floral beds constructed. In 1954 soil was brought in and grass re-seeded, with the \"restoration\" completed in 1956.\r\nThe planting of the space is very similar to that of 1918. The best trees survive in a scatter in the northern half (two Horse Chestnuts, a Lime, and a London Plane). To the south there are a Lime and a Sycamore.  Flowering cherries, presumably dating from the works of 1956, are planted round the perimeter. There are flower beds across the lawns, including a central raised bed. The path runs around the perimeter.\r\nThe railings and gates around the central garden are listed Grade II (Listed Building number 901-1/6/1908)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building was a rendered, jettied timber-framed house of a single bay which probably dated to the later-seventeenth or early-eighteenth century, presumably originally with a gabled roof. The Temple Street frontage measured 15 feet 6 inches [4.7 metres] wide and the plot extended around 50 feet [15 metres] backwards. The front and rear walls of the building were at least 2 feet 6 inches [0.75 metres] thick and the party walls were 4 feet [1.2 metres] thick..\r\nThe main, east-facing, elevation had an entrance door on the southern side of the ground-floor with a canted bay window to its north. The first and second floors were jettied over the ground-floor and the first floor fenestration comprised a square bay window containing a 12 over 12 pane sash. At second-floor there was a three-light window, the wider central light with a horizontal 9 over 9 pane sash.\r\nThe original internal plan is not currently clear and the interior had been significantly altered by the time of demolition. There were apparently three rooms on both the first and second floors. The tap-room, parlour and kitchens were more than a foot below pavement level. By the late-nineteenth century the building had a \"square-head\" attic with a flat roof, probably formed by raising the original gable roof. Part of the top of the gable appears still to have been extant in 1907.\r\nThere was a yard to the rear of the house, and a large skittle alley.\r\nIn the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries a number of carriers worked from the property. It belonged to Owen's Charity and was described in 1877 a \"Dwelling houses, yard and premises\" in the tenure of George Neate (Anon. 1877, 26).\r\nWhen Victoria Street was created in the later-nineteenth century the building was renumbered as No.117, Victoria Street. It closed as a licensed house in the late 1880s and its condition subsequently deteriorated. The building was demolished in 1907 and was observed by John Pritchard shortly beforehand (BUAD 697). He reports that traces of original window frames were found in the main elevation during demolition, as well as moulded beams in the ceiling of the first-floor room. Pritchard believed that the inn yard was then occupied by the warehouses of Messrs.

Seyer (1821 270-271) described the tower as being 22 feet in external diameter while the wall at ground floor level was 8 or 9 feet thick. A stone staircase at the back of the small, square, ground floor room led to the first storey. The ceiling of the ground floor room was arched and groined without ribs. The roof when Seyer observed it was of tile with common eaves. The drawings show a shallow polygonal or pyramidal roof. The fabric of the tower was of rubble stone and evidence of a change in construction roughly in the middle of the tower is visible, indicating where the tower had been extended. There were doors at the centre of the structure at ground- and first-floor levels, and at second floor there was a small window opening.. The tower is recorded by the plan of the city produced by Plumley and Ashmead in 1828 and Stone (1909) records that the tower was demolished in 1879. The site of the bastion is now partly beneath a corner of the rear part of the Crown Court building but the medieval element mainly lies within yard of the Central Police Station. The line of the town wall to the north of the bastion also runs beneath the yard. The state of preservation of the bastion and wall is currently unknown."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building had a 12.5 metre wide frontage on Jacob's Wells Road and extended backwards to the south-west. The form of the building is currently unclear but it was rectangular, measuring 42 metres from north-east to south-west, and narrowed to 8.5 metres in width to the rear of the element on the street front. The theatre opened on 3 July 1729 (Barker 1974, 4) and aimed to draw much of its audience from those visiting the spa at Hotwells. It staged a summer season of plays performed by actors established on the London stage.\r\nHippisley still owned the theatre at his death in c.1748 and it was inherited by his wife who appears to have sold the lease to a consortium but continued to act as Box-Book Keeper (Barker 1974, 5). The seasons included some performances with a strong political resonance in the Bristol context; notably Southerne's stage adaptation of Oroonoko which was staged three times in the summer of 1763. The fortunes of the theatre declined as the spa waned in importance and competition emerged with the opening of the New Theatre in 1766 (BUAD 15M; later renamed Theatre Royal). The leading actor of one of the final seasons,.William Powell, was invited to lead the New Theatre company and the Jacob's Wells Theatre appears have closed after the 1765 season.\r\nThe playhouse was subsequently demolished and replaced by cottages, which were in turn removed for \"industrial housing,\" and is now the site of post-Second World War flats."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

A large stone lintel above an opening into the northern of the chambers appears to carry part of an inscription in Hebrew. The interpretation of the inscription is currently uncertain but Emanuel and Ponsford (1994) suggest that is \"zochalim\" (\"flowing\").

The monument is also close to the Jewish cemetery known as Jew's Acre which was located on the site of the Queen Elizabeth's Hospital building and it was therefore argued that the monument was more likely to be a bet tohorah or cleansing house where the ceremony of washing the dead was carried out before burial.\r\nThe monument went out of use with the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290 and it was then incorporated into the conduit (BUAD 934M) supplying water to St. Augustine's Abbey and St. Mark's Hospital.\r\nMedieval mikva'ot are rare in Europe and the only other examples known from the British Isles, are those found in London in 1986 at Guildhall House, Gresham Street and in 2001 at Nos.1-6 Milk Street (Blair et al., 2001; Hillaby & Sermon 2004).

Elements of the park may be medieval in origin, since this was part of the estate of the adjacent Abbey of St. Augustine. At the creation of the diocese of Bristol in 1542 the lands of the former abbey were divided between the Bishop and the Dean and Chapter. The Abbot's Lodging and the Abbot's Park were granted to the Bishop. The park is recorded by James Millerd's 1673 map while Jean Rocque's 1742 'A Plan of the City of Bristol' shows the \"BISHOP'S PARK\" bounded by Cow or Limekiln Lane, the Rope Walk at Canons Marsh, and the rears of buildings fronting College Green and Lower College Green. Towards the south-western end of the park the plan shows three ponds (BUAD 1060A-1062A), the northern (a fishpond?) being the largest, triangular in shape, perhaps dammed at its southern end, while the others were irregular, one of them connected with the large drainage ditch that ran along the northern edge of Canons Marsh. No evidence of the largest pond was found during archaeological excavation on its putative site on the south side of Deanery Road.\r\nIn March 1770 the then Bishop of Bristol, Thomas Gooch, leased the Park to Samuel Worrall who was to develop it with housing: \"The said close of ground should be improved by buildings to be erected theron and whereas the said Samuel Worrall hath formed a plan for covering the said close of ground with buildings to which plan there is a street called College Street of the breadth of forty feet from front to front of the second story of the intended houses out of which is taken three feet for areas or bow windows on the first story or ground floor and five feet for a paved foot-way which leaves twenty four feet carriage. \" (BRO DC/E./40/28/2). The main sewer to serve the housing was reported to have been completed in September 1770 (Ison 1952, 210) and 1775 eight houses in College Street were occupied according to Sketchley's directory of Bristol. The leases on the individual properties reverted to the Bishop and in 1853 he issued a new lease to William Tanner, a property speculator (BRO 21054(2)). The Bishop sold his interest in the Park to Tanner in May 1871 (BRO 21054(7)). The land remained in a single ownership until June 1950 when the individual plots composing the estate were sold at auction (BRO 21054 (17))."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

A house of probable seventeenth century date on the west side of Redcliff Street. The tenement plot was laid out in the medieval period as part of the general development of Redcliffe. During the late-medieval period a Pennant sandstone rubble building occupied the site and part of its south wall has survived. The building appears to have been at least partially reconstructed during the seventeenth or early-eighteenth century. A plan of 1894 suggests that the ground floor comprised a room on the street front with a parlour behind. A yard separated the main building from a detached kitchen and a passage ran along the south side of the building. The building was of three storeys according to the Goad Fire Insurance plan of January 1887.\r\nIn 1687 the tenement was leased by Benjamin Adams and the rate books indicate that the building was known as The Coopers' Arms by 1695 when Christopher Legg was assessed for the property. Henry Bevan, glazier, seems to have been in possession of the building between 1707 and the late 1740s, though there appear to have been a series of occupants. It was owned by the Society of Hoopers in the 1740s according to a plan by De Wilstar (BRO 04479(1) fo.26-27). Abuttals from deeds relating to The Golden Lion record the property as \"a house formerly of David Harris\" (BRO 35447 Box 2 Bdl.VII) and by 1775 James Emery, victualler, was the occupier as tenant to Maria Sheard. The rate books indicate that there was also a stable on the site at that date. In the nineteenth century the building was housed J. & M. B. Warry, watchmakers, and later became the premises of Thomas Hall, a metalworker.

The cave is believed to have been formed by hydrothermal action in a buried Carboniferous limestone ridge around 160 million years ago and a fault or bedding plane controlled the upward flow of water from the cave. It is currently (07/12/2006) the only known fossil hydrothermal cave in the United Kingdom. The main cave is approximately 100 metres long and 60 metres deep and has extensive deposits of the mineral calcite (Calcium carbonate) on the cave walls. There is also a series of galleries to the south-east of the main chamber, also part of the hydrothermal system which formed the cave, which were identified in the eighteenth century. Their precise location and extent is now unknown.\r\nThe cave is reported to have been discovered in 1669 by lead miners (Southwell 1683), apparently working a possible small quarry which appears to lie immediately north-east of the current entrance to the cave. On 2nd July 1669 Captain Samuel Sturmy (1633-1669) made a descent by rope into the cave. Sturmy was a local mariner who lived in St. George. When he retired from the sea he became a customs officer at the Port of Bristol. After leaving this post Sturmy made a series of observations of the tides in the Severn which were communicated to the Royal Society, produced a plan of Bristol (which is now lost), and published the Mariner's Mirror (1669). Sturmy is reported to have caught a chill after his exploration of the cave and died as a result (Southwell 1683; Kenney 1947). Several individuals and groups have subsequently explored the cave and several measured surveys have been made, including one by Captain Greenville Collins in 1682, one by William White in 1775-1776 [this survey is in the collections of Bristol Reference Library B10158], and another by the University of Bristol Spelaeological Society (UBSS) in 1992 (SMR 20138). An extensive investigation was undertaken by the Cave Research Group of Great Britain in 1962 (SMR 24512; Tratman 1963). Geophysical surveys to establish the extent of the cave took place in 2006, including a Ground Penetrating Radar survey (SMR 5087; Thomas 2006) and a radio location survey (SMR 24511).\r\nHistorically the cave has frequently been misinterpreted as a lead mine and there are signs of prospection within it. A proposal to work it was made in 1843, although this does not seem to have been executed. The evidence for prospection probably relates to this episode (Mullan 1993).\r\nPen Park Hole was sealed in 1962 following the Cave Research Group Survey. It was reopened in 1992 for the survey by the University of Bristol Spelaeological Society (UBSS) survey and a permanent, lockable entrance was created at that time.\r\nThe cave is owned by Bristol City Council. Access is administered by UBSS, the Bristol Exploration Club and the Wessex Caving Club."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The castle replaced a motte and bailey castle (BUAD 940M) which was constructed after the Norman conquest in 1066. The motte and bailey was removed and the castle largely reconstructed in the early-twelfth century. The bailey ditch appears to have been realigned on the western side of the site and a barbican gate created. The castle was enclosed by a tall curtain wall constructed of Pennant sandstone with ashlar detailing to the openings. Internally the castle was divided into two wards, the outer ward on the western side in which the keep, the Constable's quarters and the Chapel of St. Martin were located, while the Great Hall, another chapel and the kitchens stood in the eastern, inner, ward (Neale 2000, 240-241). To the south, in the area between Queen Street and the River Avon was the Kings Orchard.\r\nDuring the Anarchy, the fighting for the Crown which followed the death of Henry I in 1135, Bristol castle was the centre of power of the Angevin party supporting Henry's daughter Matilda (Fleming 2004, 4-5). In the mid-twelfth century Henry II took control of the castle and made it a Royal fortress. The maintenance of the Castle seems to have been a drain on Royal resources and the accounts of the Constables of the Castle record numerous repairs in the thirteenth and fourteenth century. Particularly in the later middle ages, a level of disrepair seems to have been tolerated.\r\nThe castle was sold to the Bristol Corporation by the Crown in the 1630s. It was reinforced during the First Civil War (1642-1646) and acted as the headquarters for the parliamentarian governor of Bristol, Nathaniel Fiennes. A total of 33 cannon were sited at different locations in the Castle at the time of its capture in July 1643 (Roy 1975, 262-263).\r\nThe castle was demolished relatively rapidly in the late 1650s to make way for the development of housing on the site, and the stone was apparently recovered for use in the construction of the houses. However, some elements seem to have escaped immediate removal. James Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol suggests that the west curtain wall was still standing at that date. Part of the south curtain wall also survived, as did the building known as the Vaulted Chambers - thought to be part of the entrance to the Great Hall.\r\nArchaeological investigation of the site has been relatively limited but there have been two campaigns of excavation, one in the late 1940s and early 1950s and one in he late 1960s which was directed by M. W. Ponsford of the Department of Archaeology of the City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery (Ponsford 1979).\r\nThe only elements now visible above ground are the Vaulted Chambers, a rock-cut sally port and a section of the south curtain wall."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The Tolzey was a court and was probably where market dues were collected or enforced and was in existence by 1331 (Bickley 1900, 41). The medieval form of the building is not, however, clear as the building was rebuilt in 1550. This may perhaps have been a reworking of the earlier structure rather than total reconstruction. However, in 1617 it was reconstructed again, the height increased to admit five tall windows. By 1657 the Corporation had purchased the adjacent house, on the corner with Broad Street, in order to increase the accommodation.\r\nThe building was damaged by a fire of unknown severity soon after the Restoration. A vignette in the border of James Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol records the repaired structure. This shows a building of two storeys with a five-window range. There was a central entrance between pairs of arched cross-windows. A colonnade (BUAD 1063A) with either a flat or lean-to roof protected the area in front of the ground floor and above the bay leading to the Tolzey entrance was a statue of a monarch (probably that of Charles II later at the Guildhall (BUAD 53M). Three nails were sited in this area, apparently between the columns. At first floor there were five windows, each of six lights, mullion and transom. Above each window was a shield or plaque, with the Royal Arms in the centre. The bays of the Corn Street elevation were divided by a series of pilasters or buttresses, each capped by either an heraldic animal or a crocketted finial, and were of unequal width. The form of the roof is not indicated by Millerd and is therefore unknown.\r\nThe Tolzey was removed to make way for construction of a Council House (BUAD 341M) in 1701-1704. The colonnade was given to the parishioners of St. Nicholas and apparently removed from the site."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The church stood on the south-west corner of Small Street and Corn Street.

However, the cult of St. Werburga apparently underwent a revival after the translation of the saint's remains to Ely in 1095 (Ridyard 1988, 186n) and the dedication may therefore post-date the Norman Conquest. The church is first directly recorded in a charter of 1148-1183.\r\nThe four-stage tower (with stair turret in north-west corner) was on the south, or Corn Street, side. On the west side at second-stage level was one two-light arched window. Upper half with two-light traceried panels or blind arches, three to each stage, the central ones with some openings.\r\nThe east end was taken down, and the church truncated, in 1759 to improve access into Small Street (Evans, 1824 278). At this time some of the monuments were removed to William Reeves house at Arnos Court.\r\nWhen the church re-opened in 1762, the north elevation comprised five bays, with a short sixth bay at the east end. Large windows with geometrical tracery; no window in eastern bay. Porch in second bay from west, ogee-headed arch over entrance, possible room above porch; walls with cinquefoil-headed panels. 3-stage buttresses to church. A small plain single-storey building against east end of the elevation. \r\nArcades of two-centred arches marked the division of the two aisles, which were either side of nave. 4-light window high in west end of nave.\r\nThe interior, looking west, was recorded by Johnson in 1828 (M2458) when there were box pews in nave.

Part of a monument of Elizabethan or Jacobean date was drawn by O'Neill, 1820 (M3450) A blank end wall to Small Street, at least at its northern end where one gable end is recorded.\r\nThe church was demolished in 1878 to enable Small Street to be widened. A public meeting chaired by the Lord Mayor in March 1876 argued to retain at least the tower (Anon. 1876, 250) but the Bristol Corporation resolved by 30 votes to 23 to demolish the entire structure in December 1876 (Anon. 1876, 1270). The site was sold to South Western Bank for £15130 and subsequently redeveloped as a bank. Elements of the building were re-used in a new church at Mina Road (Listed Grade II*).

The buildings remained uncompleted for nearly two decades but the terrace had apparently been completed by 1815.\r\nThe building is a rendered three-storey house with attic and basement.

White set down regulations for the management of the almshouse in the same year (Manchee 1831, 518-521).\r\nThe original range of almshouse was a jettied structure of three-storeys.

The Bristol Sailors Home was constructed by the Sailors Home Committee from 1851 (Pilkington, 2000) and was a conversion of the stable/warehouse, counting house and kitchen of No.29 Queen Square (BUAD 1463M) together with the western of a row of four houses constructed c1778 on The Grove. The works included reconstruction of the elevation to The Grove (BRO 40311/B/1 fol.17), the creation of an entrance hall towards the east side of the building at ground-floor and the insertion of a chimney stack against the west wall (Leech, 2002). The shell walls of the c1778 house formed the eastern rooms of the structure.\r\nThe building was recorded in a photograph of the 1870s, and as completed was a three-storey, four-bay structure with four hipped pantile roofs, three retained from the stable/warehouse to the west of the main entrance door and the other the roof of the c1778 house to the east. The main, south-facing elevation was of rendered rubble stone. The ground-floor level was of rusticated ashlar with moulded voussoirs above the window openings. The main entrance door is located towards the eastern side of the building, between the third and fourth ground-floor window and  its opening is surrounded by a moulding. The upper floors of the elevation were plain except for a pilaster which extended to the base of the parapet and divided the western bay from the rest. The fenestration appears to have comprised large sashes in all of the windows although the window opening at the east end of the second floor was blocked. The legend \"SAILOR'S HOME\" was painted between the first- and second-floor windows.\r\nThe original internal organisation of the building is not currently clear. At the front of the building, to the west of the entrance hall there was a single large room at each floor. The ceiling of the ground-floor room was supported on cast iron columns and may have been an association area. The upper floors are likely to have been dormitory space. At first floor in the east range (the former counting house) a metal safe for the inmates valuables was constructed against the party wall. During the twentieth century a number of alterations were made to the interior, including the insertion of partitions to create individual bedrooms in the large first and second-floor rooms and suspended ceilings on the ground floor. These alterations were removed in 2002. The site remained in use as a sailors home until the 1990s. It was converted to offices in 2003.\r\nThe building was surveyed by Jayne Pilkington in 2000 (BUAD 3627; Pilkington 2000) and by Dr. Roger Leech in 2002 (BUAD 3913; Leech 2002; 2003).

The mill was in extstence by the early 1870s (Winstone 1966, pls.62-63) and its form remained very similar until 1883 when the mill was surveyed for the Ordnance Survey first edition Town plan (Bristol Sheet LXXII.13.22). There were entrances to the site off Stephen Street and New Kingsley Road which led into an open metalled yard. On the north side of this yard, adjacent to the gateway on to New Kingsley Road, there was a two-storey stone rubble building with a hipped pantile roof. This had a steep flight of steps, apparently wooden, leading up to first-floor level. To the west of this was a detached square building and to the west again, a four storey building constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble, possibly a warehouse. This had at least nine bays and each bay contained small arched windows. Along the north side of the yard, on the south side of these buildings, there was a surface of large setts forming a vehicular route.\r\nOn the south side of the yard was a single-storey L-shaped shed (at ST 59772 72932) measuring 55 metres from east to west and 22 metres wide. The main element of the shed was aligned roughly east-west and had at least fifteen bays while the shorter, north-south, arm of the building had only three bays. The northern wall of the building stood on the Stephen Street frontage of the site close to the gateway off Stephen Street. The building was constructed of coursed Pennant sandstone rubble and had a pitched clay tiled roof. Each bay contained a single large casement window with a flat relieving arch above the opening. In the yard immediately to the north of this building and parallel to it there were six rows of drying racks for the flax, each formed by timber posts standing approximately 1.5 metres high which were connected by horizontal rails 2-3 metres long. Attached to the eastern end of the L-shaped building, and slightly set back from it, was a taller three-bay building of three storeys with a pitched tiled roof. The side, north-west facing, elevation contained three arched casement windows at second-floor level.\r\nA rectangular building of two-storeys and attic stood on the New Kingsley Road frontage of the site (at ST 59812 72953), immediately to the north of these buildings and adjacent to the arched gateway opening on to New Kingsley Road. This measured 9.5 metres from east to west and 5.5 metres across and was constructed of rubble stone. The main, north-east facing, elevation was apparently of three bays, with sash windows at first floor. A dormer window with a pitched roof projected from the eaves at attic level and at either end of the roof there was a group of three tall chimney stacks. The side, north-west facing, wall was a single bay and has a projecting stone rubble porch with a flat roof at ground floor level. There was a single window, apparently with ashlar dressings, at first floor and another small window in the gable end. At the apex of the gable there was a bellcote. The functions of each of the buildings within the site is not currently (26/02/2002) clear.\r\nMuch of the yard had been developed for an extension to the northern side of the L-shaped building by the time of the Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXII.13) published in 1903. The mill buildings and, it is reported (Winstone 1966, pl.62), some of the associated machinery survived into the late 1950s. The buildings were subsequently demolished and the site redeveloped, although part of the boundary wall to the site appears to survive and some of the fabric of the late nineteenth-century extension to the L-shaped shed seems to have been incorporated into the new warehouse on the site."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The date of origin of the church is currently unknown and it has been suggested that it may have originated as a chapel to an adjacent manor house in the area of Park Lane. However, the church was in existence by 1148 when William, Earl of Gloucester confirmed the grant of the advowson to Tewkesbury Abbey. The abbey appears to have exercised its right to appoint through its cell, St. James Priory (BUAD 1024M).\r\nThe form of the medieval church is known only in outline. The tower, dated to the mid-fifteenth century, and had a four-stage tower. The nave and chancel are only known from visual sources; Jean Rocque's 1742 'A Plan of the City of Bristol' shows the church in outline plan while a drawing by James Stewart records the south-east side. There were both north and south porches, and the south aisle terminated at the eastern side of the tower.\r\nSt. James Priory was dissolved in January 1540. The advowson of the rectory was acquired by Henry Brayne in 1544 as part of his purchase of the property of the Priory in 1544.\r\nRumney Penrose became rector on 25 June 1743 and he was succeeded by John Culliford in Octotober 1749. In 1763 the south wall of the church was reported to be bulging outwards as a result of the weight and spreading of the roof. On 6 1764 February, after Culliford had died, Samuel Seyer, master of the Grammar School and a local antiquarian, became rector.\r\nTo expand the accommodation and presumably also in response to identified structural weakness, the church was rebuilt between 1775 and 1777 to designs by Thomas Paty, although the late-medieval tower was retained. A new organ was built and was first recorded in the church in 1793. This was rebuilt by John Smith senior of the Bristol organ builders John Smith and Sons between 1819 and 1821.

The property containing a spring close to present Constitution Hill was granted to Henry de Gaunt master of St. Mark's Hospital at College Green in c.1235-45, thereby giving the right to the water to the Hospital of St. Mark and St. Augustine's Abbey. The conduit was also recorded by the 1373 perambulation of the new County of Bristol (Harding 1930, 154-155).\r\nThe conduit collected water from several springs on the hill below Bellevue and elsewhere above Jacobs Wells Road into a series of underground chambers.

A plan by William Halfpenny of 1742 shows the chambers along Jacobs Wells Road connected by conduits and these combined to a single watercourse beneath the centre of the road south-east of the junction of Constitution Hill and Jacobs Wells Road. According to a plan of mid-nineteenth century date in the Corporation Plan Books the conduit then ran down Jacobs Wells Road and along St. George's Road to a conduit head at Unity Street. There was a feather close to the junction of York Place and St. George's Road to serve St. Augustine's Abbey. This ran south-east to the St Augustine's conduit head in the lower cloister, now College Square, and the water was then presumably carried to the north-east to serve the refectory of the abbey.

A warehouse occupying the whole of the north-west side of St. Augustine's Yard and extending back as far as the rears of Nos.20 to 24a Orchard Street. Large 18th/19th.century warehouse, constructed in three or four phases. Four storeys; seven bays. Rubble contruction, mostly Pennant Sandstone, with brick details. Grey, white and whitish mortars identified. Seven parallel hipped pantile roofs, one above each bay. Cellars to four left-hand bays, each similar and interconnected, with rubble walls, brick barrel vaults and Pennant flagstone floors. In some areas the ground and first floors were knocked together. The earliest part comprised the two left-hand bays, with curved east corner; these bays were set forward of the remaining five; original north-east external wall partly survived. Possibly contemporary was the fourth bay, also with a curved corner, but whose facade was set back from that of the left pair of bays. It also had a former external wall surviving, the south-west. The third bay of the warehouse was formed by roofing over the yard between the earlier buildings and inserting floors. The three right-hand bays appeared to be the latest build, and were of reduced depth. They had concrete floors, whereas the other bays were floored with Pennant flagstones. There were an assortment of doors and windows at all storeys of the seven-bay facade. At the north-east end of bay 2 was a lead rainwater-head, bearing the initials ' R S ' above the date 1774. The various storeys were linked by vehicle ramps. This had been Bristol's first multi-storey car park. Much of the building was supported internally by walls between the bays, some with pierced by arches, but there were also steel stanchions in places. Cast-iron columns supported the roof between the first and second and third and fourth bays. Timber roofs, mostly carried on collared trusses, but the third bay with braced collars. Top floor lit additionally by skylights. Some hoists at the front of the building. \r\nThe Bristol SMR (BSMR 6159) notes that a building (possibly this one), consisting of two houses and land on which was a warehouse and brass foundry with entrances to Denmark Street and Orchard Street, advertised for sale in the Bristol Journal, 30 March 1771."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The dock lay at the bottom of Jacobs Wells Road. It was built into a pill at the bottom of Woodwell Lane (modern Jacobs Wells Road) reputedly in 1626.

John Evans . and also all that piece of void ground on part whereof a dock lately made by him..\" (quoted in Insole 1998) but it is not clear whether this was a mud dock operating in the pill or a dry dock. However, Rocque's 1742 map of Bristol records the dock as a dry dock though indicates no ancillary buildings. The dock passed to Edward Blandy in 1712 and the lease was assigned to Captain Joseph Osborne in 1721. The Osborne family sold the lease to John Roach in 1794 but by 1809 the dock was in the hands of Hilhouse and Company. Paintings of the dock from the opposite side of the Floating Harbour (BSRMG M2961; BRMSG M2942) indicate that substantial buildings had been erected to the west of the dock by 1822. By the 1850s the dock was leased to Charles Hill. The dock was too small to accommodate most ships of the period and as a result the dock gates ceased to function. Consequently the dock was out of use for ten years in the 1870s. It was extended to landward in the early 1880s and a new steel caisson inserted. It was extended again in 1893. The dock and its buildings were sold to the Great Western Railway for £5000 at the end of the nineteenth century to allow the extension of the Harbour railway (McGrath 1975, 345).\r\nThe western wall of the dock and part of the buildings to its west were archaeologically excavated in 1998 (BUAD 3398) (Cox 1999).

In plan it is likely to have had a central entrance hall with room on either side at both ground and first floor levels, perhaps with an archway for a coach at the northern end and a small servant's room with a window facing on to St. Matthew's Road.

The painting was originally more extensive but the majority has been lost.\r\nThe building appears to have been altered during a programme of remodelling around the end of the eighteenth century.

The original form of the building is not currently known but it may have been similar in form and siting to the subsequent building. Foster's will of 6 August 1492 suggests that the residential accommodation consisted of thirteen rooms (Manchee 1831, 80). The Chapel of the Three Kings of Cologne (BUAD 424M) was an integral part of the foundation and Foster established a chantry for a priest to sing daily in the chapel under the terms of his will.

The New Gaol was designed by Henry Hake Seward who was selected as the architect after an architectural competition (BRO Clerk of the Peace Deposited Plans). Construction of the gaol began in 1816 and it opened in 1820. The original plan of the gaol was recorded by Plumley and Ashmead's 1828 plan of Bristol and consisted of a gatehouse on Cumberland Road with the main elliptical area of the prison enclosed by attached stone walls to its north. The entrance gateway stood on Cumberland Road on the south side of the prison at the mid-point of the high perimeter wall. The gateway had drum towers on either corner and to the north of this, across the yard, was the Governor's House. This had five bays and three storeys and there was a large arched gateway in the centre of the ground floor on the south front. The cell blocks radiated from the Governor's House to the east, west, north-east and north-west and were connected to it by walkways at third-floor level. The cell blocks on the east and west sides each had fourteen bays and three storeys. Chimney stacks projected from the hipped roofs of both of these blocks. The water supply was drawn from a well by a treadmill pump and distributed to cisterns around the prison by a system of pipes but the well became contaminated with water from the Floating Harbour in the summer months, blocking the pipes and requiring that drinking water be bought in. The plan form of the New Gaol suggests that Seward was influenced by Bentham's panopticon principle. Certainly, management of the prison conformed to the emphases on surveillance and separation which characterised early- to mid-Victorian penal theory.\r\nDuring the Bristol riots of 1831 the prison was attacked by the rioters. The prisoners were released and the buildings, including the Governor's house were burned. The gaol was subsequently rebuilt by R. S. Pope but how extensive Pope's rebuilding of the gaol was, and how far it altered Seward's original design, has yet to be defined. The separate system was introduced into the prison at the beginning of the 1840s (Wood et al. n.d.) and it influenced subsequent alterations to the building, including the creation of stalls within the chapel to ensure prisoners could only view the chaplain (see Winston 1965 pl.70). Overcrowding had also become a problem at the gaol by the 1840s and the day rooms were converted into ten extra cells. By the 1860s the chapel was located between the two cell blocks to the west of the Governor's House. The treadmill was sited in a building adjacent to the north-eastern cell block. Another round of alterations was proposed in 1869.\r\nThe New Gaol was closed in 1883. The site was purchased by the Great Western Railway Company in 1895 and the majority of the structure was demolished in 1898 to allow development of Wapping Wharf but the gateway and parts of the perimeter wall are still extant. These have a Grade II listing (Listed Building numbers 901-1/42/1295 (Entrance gate) and 901-1/42/1296 (Perimeter wall)).

A town wall of thirteenth century date which enclosed development outside the core of the medieval town. The wall ran from the Back (modern Welsh Back) westwards along the northern side of King Street, almost to the Key (modern Broad Quay), then turned northwards for an unknown distance, probably terminating at Viell's Great Tower near the western end of modern Baldwin Street. The wall was pierced by gates at the Back, Back Street and Marsh Street. Smith's map of Bristol, 1568, suggests that there was a ditch in front of the wall for at least the east-west section. Documentary evidence from the sixteenth and seventeenth century evidence suggests that houses and other structures were built in front of the wall, and Millerd's 1673 map tends to confirm this.\r\nA bastion was excavated by K. J. Barton in 1960 (BUAD 441) at the rear of St. Nicholas with Burton's Almshouses (Barton 1964) which was left, and remains, exposed after the excavation and which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

The property belonged to the Norton family from 1402, and its frontage was measured at 75 paces by William Worcestre in 1478. The medieval form of the building is unclear but the seventeenth-century ranges abutted an earlier, medieval, two-storey range with at least three bays. The arch-braced roof with wind braces over the room later known as the Court Room was also of medieval date (Simpson 1926, pl.9).\r\nThe building was acquired by the merchant Robert Aldworth in 1607 as his residence and was refronted by him in 1612-1613. The building was at that date a four-bay jettied structure with gabled pantile roofs. The north-west facing elevation had a timber frontage with elaborate decoration, including carved jettying and carved bargeboards. The porch on the south side of the structure was internally decorated with carved wooden friezes. These were drawn by Samuel Loxton in the early twentieth century (Bristol Reference Library A34) and also photographed in the 1920s. Internally the Court Room had a decorative plasterwork ceiling and frieze, both apparently of seventeenth-century date. It also had a full height chimney-piece with a frieze beneath the mantel and a decorated overmantel with what appear to have been the Royal Arms flanked by two female figures in the central panel. It had carved phoenixes on either side of the fireplace.\r\nAfter Aldsworth's death in 1634 the building was used as a sugarhouse, believed to be the first in Bristol and to have been refining Madeira cane. During the Commonwealth the building became a mint.\r\nIn 1696 a union of the parish poor relief functions, the Corporation of the Poor, was formed after the passage of an Act of Parliament (Butcher 1932, 179-187). This was managed by a committee and housing both adults and orphaned or abandoned children, who were taught knitting, spinning and sack-making - products being sold to provide income for the Corporation. The four western bays of Aldsworth's house were taken over and became known as St. Peter's Hospital (also known as the Mint Workhouse). The building was the administrative centre for the Corporation of the Poor and its records were held there. It also provided accommodation \"to the Number of three or fourscore Persons, young and old, chiefly Children\" (Anon., 1732) for some of those in the care of the Corporation. However, the majority were either in receipt of outdoor relief (distributed weekly at the hospital) or were accommodated at other sites around Bristol.\r\nThe hospital continued to operate until it was destroyed by bombing on 24-25 November 1940 when both the fabric of the building and the hospital's records were lost. The site has not since been redeveloped and the rear wall of the range of buildings survives.\r\nJohn Pritchard monitored the construction of a new Board Room in 1900 which involved the removal of some seventeenth-century fabric (BUAD 204; Pritchard 1900, 271-272) and a survey was made by Simpson two decades later (BUAD 531; Simpson 1926). However, there has been little archaeological work on the site since the destruction of the building, although a watching brief on landscaping works was carried out by Dr. Roger Price in 1972 (BUAD 63)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The girls' school was founded by John Elbridge, and he had apparently overseen the construction of a house and schoolroom, with an associated garden, before his death in February 1739. In his will he left £3,000 in trust \"for the better establishment\" of the school (Manchee 1831, 225-226). Elbridge leased the land parcel within which the school was constructed, Joachim's Close, from the Dean and Chapter of Bristol Cathedral until his death, and the land was presumably part of the endowment he bequeathed for the purpose of founding the school (Leech 2000, 47).\r\nThe school had certainly been constructed by 1747 when it was recorded in a drawing by James Stewart (BUAD 2766). The building was orientated from north-east to south-west, parallel with Fort Lane, and measured approximately 56 feet (17.1 metres) along the Fort Lane frontage by 15 feet (4.6 metres) wide. It was a single-storey six-bay building with a hipped roof. The fenestration of the south-east facing elevation comprised six large sashes and the side, south-west facing, elevation had a single sash at its centre. A low parapet surrounded the roof. The garden was to the north of the building. In the early-nineteenth century the school was described as consisting of \"a dwelling, with several convenient apartments, now occupied by the mistress of the school, with a school-room adjoining, though not under the same roof, and is capable of accommodating one hundred children\" (Manchee 1831, 226). It was managed by the vicar of St. Michael's and the 24 girls educated were taught \"reading, writing, summing, and plain needle-work, and they are otherwise employed so as to fit them for the business of servants. They are also instructed in the elements of christian [sic] duty and belief\" (Manchee 1831, 226).\r\nThe use of the building as a school continued through the nineteenth century and between 1816 and 1830 around £70 was spent on repairs to the building (Manchee 1831, 226). By the time of the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXI.16.14) surveyed in 1881-82 an extension had been added to the northern half of the north-east end of the building. The building was extant at the time of the Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan published in 1903 (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXI.16). However by the time of the third edition plan published in 1918 it had been demolished.\r\nRoyal Fort Road was subsequently widened and the site of the school now lies partly beneath the northern side of the road and partly within the site of the Children's Hospital."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

At right-angles to these ranges was a 3 storey 5-window late C17 range with a cornice and parapet, a central elliptical-arched doorway, cross windows with label moulds, the right-hand range separated by a pilaster strip, with a right-hand open elliptical arch, 2-centred arched first-floor window with Y tracery, and second-floor quatrefoil window. There was a 1-window right-hand return between the 2 ranges previously described, the ground-floor with an arched doorway and 2 small windows. At the north-east end of this range was a further building, running northwards to the corner of Johnny Ball Lane, built in the 1810s, a 3-storeys and 4-window range, an open arcade of four-centred arches facing the playground, cross-windows above. \r\nThe range on the south-east side of the playground largely survives; that to its north was demolished in c.1981.

The Holmes was bought by Herbert Meade-King in 1870 and sold to William Edwards George in July 1876. It is not clear whether Meade-King or George built The Holmes but the house was complete by 1879 and was leased out. The building is a two-storey structure constructed of rubble stone (apparently an Old Red sandstone) with ashlar detailing.\r\nFrom 1884 the lessee was W. Mills Baker, the father of the plant collector Hiatt C. Baker. Hiatt Baker is likely to have been responsible for the design of the formal garden created around the house which comprised a series of sinuous walks, a rockery and an area known as The Dell (Hicks 2004, 13). The Baker family let the property to Alfred Capper Pass, owner of a smelting works in Bedminster and later Professor emeritus of Chemistry at the University of Bristol, but retained ownership of the building until 1943 when it was acquired by the University of Bristol.

The plot, with a frontage on Tower Lane, was a garden known as Hasardysgarden which belonged to John Hasard, who lived in Broad Street in the mid-fourteenth century. The house in Broad Street was acquired by Edmund and Isabella Arthur in the later 1380s (Veale 1933, 204) and in 1390 Arthur granted the garden to John Knyghton and William Castell (BRO P/StJB/D/2/75) to be used as the churchyard for St. John the Baptist (BUAD 145M). Parishioners of St. John's had previously been buried in St. James Churchyard.\r\nThe grant included a right of access for the church to reach the churchyard through the gate of the tenement and the entrance to the churchyard remains in Tailor's Court. The use of the plot as a churchyard was confirmed by the Bishop of Worcester on 2nd July 1409 and it was consecrated on 12th June. The right of access appears to have been disputed by the Fraternity of St. John (the Merchant Tailors' Guild) which acquired Hasard's Broad Street tenement. On Sunday 22nd March 1489 members of the Fraternity armed themselves with daggers, swords and clubs to obstruct a procession on the path from Broad Street through Hasard's tenement to St. John's Cemetery, and closed the gates there in the face of the rector, William Thomas and others. The dispute was not resolved until 1499 when arbitrators brought the two sides to agreement. The Fraternity was to allow the parson of St. John to pass without interruption and allow the dead to be brought through the tenement. The parish received an annual rent of 13s. 4d. for Hasard's tenement, and the Fraternity was to retain 12d. of this each year towards the repair of the timber, lock and ironwork of two gates between Broad Street and the cemetery. A set of keys for these gates was to be kept by each party.\r\nThe churchyard measures 28.5 metres from south-west to north-east and is 18 metres wide, and its area has remained essentially the same, with only small changes, since the end of the fourteenth century. Archaeological excavation in 1979 (BUAD 320) recorded a strip containing graves adjacent to the existing south-east boundary of the cemetery, indicating that there was an encroachment on the cemetery during the early post-medieval period. The north-west corner of the churchyard was also removed in the third quarter of the eighteenth century to allow the creation of John Street. The burials do not appear to have been cleared from this area, and in the 1960s a grave was discovered there (BUAD 567). The Pennant sandstone rubble boundary walls and the limestone ashlar gate piers are of eighteenth-century date. Within the churchyard there are a number of post-medieval monuments and gravestones, notably the tomb of Hugh Brown (BUAD 378M) which is of seventeenth-century date and is sited against the south-east boundary wall of the churchyard.\r\nThe burial ground was reported to be full in 1850 with an average of thirteen interments each year (Clark 1850, 158). The churchyard was closed to burials by an Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852.\r\nThe walls, piers, gates and railings of the churchyard are listed Grade II (Listed Building number 901-1/11/680)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The hall was constructed on the sites of Nos.9 and 10 Charles Street (BUAD 1655M and BUAD 1656M) and was designed by the local architect William Venn Gough (the plans in the BRO Building Plans Book 36 are dated 11 May 1899). The building was a two-storey brick building with a pitched roof supported on corbels. The Charles Street façade was apparently of freestone ashlar. There was a central entrance consisting of a pair of semi-circular arches with rusticated voussoirs and a smaller semi-circular arched window on the north-east side, all of which broke through a projecting moulded cornice. At first-floor level there were four smaller semi-circular arched window openings with rusticated keystones of which the central two were blind. Above a string course were seven smaller lancet windows, also with semi-circular arched heads, occupying the two central bays. The gable above was stepped with pyramidal finials (Winstone 1972, pl.53). The side elevations had six bays, each with a large semi-circular arched tracery window, and a clerestorey above with three lancet windows in each bay. Against the north-western wall of the building there was a further two-thirds height rear bay with a lean-to roof. The entrance steps projected from the south-western side of the building, off the alley leading to Seville Court.\r\nInternally the ground floor plan comprised a hall occupying most of the centre of the building, an entrance lobby, kitchen and gallery above at the south-eastern, Charles Street, end. At the north-western end were the ladies and gentlemen's retiring rooms. The basement was reached by steps on the western side of the building and included a classroom and a smaller room on the eastern side accommodating the heating equipment.\r\nThe parish hall remained in use until the Second World War but was damaged by bombing. It remained a shell into the early 1950s but by 1954 the building appears to have been re-roofed and was in use as a warehouse for electrical goods. The original elevation of the building was removed after 1957 to create a larger entrance off Charles Street. Street directories record that the parish hall building was occupied by Midland Electrical Engineering between 1960 and 1969."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Traditionally the building is said to include features salvaged from the medieval St. Werburgh's Church which was rebuilt by James Bridges between 1758 and 1761 (Ison, 1952 187-189). The building has a courtyard, entered through an archway beneath a tower. The buildings ranged around this courtyard have pointed tracery windows and doorways. Opposite the entrance is a larger tower with diagonal abutment. The outer angles are formed by tall circular turrets. A feature is the use of \"copper slag\" blocks from Reeve's works to construct the walling. The entrance front is symmetrical, 2-bay wings flanked by turrets flank with a central tower over the entrance. Originally the surviving entrance arch stood in front of this building but was moved in 1912 to stand in front of the bath-house (SMR 6327).\r\nThe building has a Grade I listing (Listed Building 901-1/56/466)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The friary was founded in 1227/8 by Maurice de Gaunt (R. Graham The religious houses. In Page 1907). Its layout has not yet been confirmed but the friary church (BUAD 1359M) appears to have been located on the north side of the site close to Rosemary Lane. On its south side was the cloister, with the church lying along its northern edge, the frater to its west, and the chapter house, sacristy, etc., on the eastern side. Cutler's Hall, is likely to have been the dorter and to the south of this was the lesser cloister. The building now known as Bakers Hall may have been the infirmary.\r\nThe house was surrendered on 10th September 1538. The site was purchased by the former mayor William Chester in June 1540 for £37 10s and was apparently used as a private dwelling with many of the buildings of the friary apparently being put to new use with the minimum of new building. The church would appear to have been incorporated into other buildings, although some of the stone was used to rebuild an altar and Easter sepulchre in St. Werburgh's church in 1552-53 (Skeeters 1993, 82). In 1933 tracery windows dating to the fourteenth century was discovered within one of the walls of a garage (BUAD 2378). The larger of these was damaged but survived to its full height, suggesting that demolition of the friary church after the dissolution was partial and at least some of its fabric was incorporated into other buildings. The site was acquired by the wealthy grocer Dennis Hollister in the mid seventeenth century for his residence and when he joined the fledgling Quaker movement in the city in 1654 open air meetings were held there. The Society of Friends meeting house (BUAD 241M) was later added to the rear of the linking block, New Hall.\r\nTwo of the conventual buildings, later known as the Bakers Hall (BUAD 239M) and Cutlers Hall (BUAD 240M), are extant along with part of a linking block.

The primary entrance was in the central bay, and was formed by a large arch with a double doorway set within it. Above this was a large, two-light window while close to the head of the gable there was a circular window with an elaborate sill. The fenestration in the two adjacent bays was formed by small segmental arched windows and there were similar lights in the south wall of the building.

The side aisles had separate roofs.\r\nThe interior of the building seems to have formed a assembly single space five bays long, which was divided by stone Tuscan columns into nave and aisles. The nave ceiling was coved with a central octagonal lantern and there were galleries around the north, west and south sides. The pulpit was sited against the east wall of the building and had a square base, pedimented back panel and was accessed via two staircases, one on its north and one on its south side (Stell 1986, 63).

A number of brick burial vaults were sited within it the floor and there was also a vault for W. D. Wills (Winstone 1987, pl.54).\r\nThe chapel later became a Congregational chapel. The interior was partly refitted in the nineteenth century.\r\nImmediately to the south of the chapel was the 1834 Sunday school (BUAD 90M), with Whitefield's house (later used as a vestry) behind it.\r\nThe building was demolished to the level of the base of the crypt in the second half of 1958 to make way for the development of Broadmead shopping centre. The Smith organ is reported to have been installed in the United Reform Church , Gloucester Road, Horfield in 1960.

This was taken out of use at the order of the Health Authority in 1887.\r\nBoucher gives the following description of the pump at Stourhead:\r\n\"It is hexagonal in form and consists of two storeys, surmounted by a shaft raised above a six-sided pedestal.

However, there is little doubt that they represented kings and queens with Bristol or local connexions.\r\nThe jambs are panelled and moulded. Over each of them there is a large carved fleur-de-lys and at the intersection of each pair or [sic] arches is a little pedestal supporting the carved figure of an animal, either a lion or a bear bearing a shield, but they are badly weathered.\r\nThe large pedestal carrying the crowning shaft has six carved panels.

James Millerd's 1673 vignette show that the wings were one bay wide, with two gables on their inner sides, and the rear of the street range also possessed two gables. All of main windows were of eight lights.\r\nThe arrangment of the interior has not been researched although seventeenth-century inventories record a great hall, \"little studdie\" and outhouses, a coach house and stables as well as a water cistern to control supply to the main house (Hall 1949, 122-123).\r\nThe initial plan included a garden, apparently walled and raised above the level of the courtyard, on the north side of the house. Its northern boundary was Trenchard Street. Later Sir John Yonge began to acquire plots on the hillside on the opposite side of Trenchard Street to create a larger garden for the house (Roger Leech pers. comm.). The White Lodge and the Red Lodge marked the edges of this garden.\r\nThe house provided the accommodation for Queen Elizabeth during her visit to Bristol in 1574. The building became a sugar house in 1653. Water for its three pans was drawn from St. John's Conduit (apparently without permission and causing a reduction in supply elsewhere) and cottages were built in the grounds of the house to provide dwellings for the refinery workers. Inventories record not only the utensils required for sugar making but also the equipment, the vats and coolers, installed in the various rooms (Hall, 1949 141). Refining continued on the site until 1708 when a school was founded in the building by Edward Colston. By 1742 it not only occupied the main house, but also a smaller building adjacent on Host Street to the east, and others fronting Trenchard Street. The building was occupied by the school into the early nineteenth century but later became an assembly rooms and art gallery. It was demolished in 1863 in order to enable construction of the Colston Hall (BUAD 69M)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The dock was built as a wet or floating dock prior to the floating of the harbour by William Champion between 1762 and 1768. It was a rectangular basin, aligned north-south, with a southern entrance lock. Two other docks, a graving dock and another wet dock, were built on its east side. Champion lost money in the venture and the docks were sold privately in 1770 to a small group of members of the Society of Merchant Venturers from whom the Society corporately bought the docks complex. The Society renamed the complex Merchants' Dock and gained an Act of Parliament in 1776 requiring ships to unload flammable materials, pitch, tar etc., there. The dock was also enlarged to accommodate sixteen vessels (McGrath 1975, 155-156).\r\nThe docks were periodically let, including to the shipbuilder George Hilhouse at the beginning of the nineteenth century and at this time a Bonding Yard (BUAD 1356M) was created to the west of the dock. The entrance lock to Merchants' Dock was truncated when Junction Lock was cut between the harbour and Cumberland Basin. By 1883 Merchants Road had been created through the Bonding Yard and cattle pens stood on the west side of the dock. The western and northern sides of the dock were infilled by the Great Western Railway as part of the works to lay a line to Canons Marsh in the early twentieth century. The remainder was filled to allow development of housing at Rownham Mead in the 1970s."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The friary was founded in 1256 and was a walled precinct with a rectangular plot on the north side of St. Augustine's Place (now Colston Street), probably defined by Pipe Lane, Host Street and Steep Street. \r\nIn the absence of archaeological excavation, the internal arrangement of the site remains uncertain but the church and burial ground seem to have been at the south-western end and may have been orientated parallel with Pipe Lane. Evidence for the form of the church itself is equally limited. William Worcestre, writing in 1480, gives two, slightly different, sets of measurements for the nave, 24 and nearly 29 metres long by 13.4 or 14.5 metres wide (Neale 2000, 50-51; 278-279). The choir was 24 metres long (Neale 2000, 50-51). By the early sixteenth century there was \"a chapell and an yle off the Church\" (Weare 1893, 74). The chapel may have been that dedicated to St. George, known to have stood in the church by 1412 (Wadley 1886, 89), although there was also a chapel dedicated to St. Mary by 1393 (Wadley 1886, 51). The tower of the church was just under 2.7 metres wide and, with the spire, Worcestre says, was 200 feet high (Neale 2000, 100-101). There were three large tracery windows at first-floor level on the Colston Street frontage (BRSMG M2531; BRSMG M2532).One architectural feature of the church to have survived the 1530s may be the screen bequeathed by Thomas White in 1542 to Bristol Cathedral. Warren identified the remnants of this as the heavily-restored late-medieval screen now set in the fourth bay of the south choir aisle (Warren 1904-08; Warren 1904).\r\nThe spatial organisation of the precinct is also uncertain. Worcestre recorded the cloister as 21.4 metres square (Neale 2000, 50-51) although its position within the precinct is unclear. The north-eastern end presumably consisted of ancillary buildings and orchard and gardens. The friary obtained its water supply from the St. John's conduit which ran along Pipe Lane and then Host Street. Worcestre also mentions a statue of St. Mary in a shrine in the precinct wall near the corner of Host Street and Steep Street (Neale 2000, 18-19). The friary appears to have had gardens extending westward towards Park Row.\r\nThe friary was surrendered on 28 July 1538 and the site was bought by the Corporation. The buildings were demolished and provided stone for rebuilding altars in several churches. A Great House (BUAD 420M) was subsequently built on the site by Sir John Young.\r\nThere have been numerous discoveries of human remains around Pipe Lane, the earliest in April 1788 (BUAD 3666; Gentleman's Magazine 1788, 455). In August and September 1904 John Pritchard recorded (BUAD 46) several sections of what he believed were medieval walls as well as a number of burials (Beddoe 1906; Pritchard 1906, 133-141). In November 1932 several more skeletons and a pavement of medieval floor tiles were found during excavation in Trenchard Street (BUAD 3308) and disarticulated human remains were discovered inside No.2 Trenchard Street in 1999 (BUAD 3464). In 1989 John Bryant recorded a window of late-medieval date about 1800 millimetres high internally in the front wall of No.2 Trenchard Street (BUAD 622)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

At the shoulder of the arches was a deep impost-band and the arches had keystones. Above these was a plat band and parapet. Each of the shops had a frontage 2.6 metres wide on Exchange Avenue and was 3.7 metres long and had a first floor level which was hidden behind the parapet. At the south end of the elevation was a doorway leading to a small rear yard and now the entrance to the toilets. In the footway of Exchange Avenue, in front of the rank is an iron plate covering the entrance to a cellar beneath the structure. The condition of this cellar is unknown.\r\nThe northern two of the rank were demolished in the early twentieth century when the rear of the Old Post Office was rebuilt and extended to the south. The southern two shops are extant and were subject to archaeological survey by Dr. Roger Leech in October 1999 [BUAD 3518] (Leech, 1999) and some stripping of plaster on selected internal walls to determine the development of the structure in early 2001 [BUAD 3761] (Leech, 2001). The rear wall of the building was found to pre-date construction of the shops. The shops have been altered internally, a scar in the rubble wall forming the north wall of the building suggesting that the roof had been altered.

The site was created by the infilling of Aldsworth's Dock in the mid-seventeenth century and a building is recorded on the site by Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol.\r\nAs built, the structure was a double-gabled house of two storeys plus attic with a pantile roof. The west-facing, Broad Quay, elevation measured 11.4 metres from north to south while the south-facing, Alderskey Lane, elevation measured 9.2 metres east-west.\r\nThe building was apparently refronted in the late-eighteenth or early-nineteenth century (Winstone 1960, pl.63) and the roof altered to a hip. In the west-facing elevation it had an entrance door at the south end with an adjacent shop window, while to the north of this were two sash windows, one against the party wall with No.77 and between them a plain door opening. Adjacent to the north of the door was an arched cellar access with a cellar drop in the footway in front of the building. A string course separated ground and first floor and the first-floor fenestration comprised sashes, the two on the north side of the elevation being slightly larger than the rest. At the south corner of the building there was a large ornate lamp supported on brackets and projecting over the footway. There were four six over six pane sash windows at second floor and these were separated from the third floor by a string course. At third floor level the fenestration consisted of four three over three pane sashes. The dentils beneath the eaves continued from No.77, suggesting that the two buildings were refronted at the same time.\r\nThe street directory for 1882 records the building as a public house, The Bell, and the licensee was then James Blake. The name had been changed by the 1980s to the Brandy Cask Hotel.\r\nThe building was apparently demolished soon after the closure of Alderskey Lane in 1900 (Pritchard 1904, 128-129) and the site was subsequently redeveloped for the Co-operative Wholesale building."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The chapel stood close to the south-west corner of St. Mary Redcliffe church and was in existence by 1363. The building measured 17 metres from east to west and was 8 metres wide.\r\nThe chapel appears initially to have had a two-cell plan with the entrance, protected by a porch, on the north side of the building. Documentary evidence suggests that the during the medieval period the chapel included an annexe for lepers, tended by the religious from the hospital of St. John the Baptist. A plan of 1717 by Lyons indicates suggests that a room, possibly this annexe, ran the full length of the wall between the porch and the western corner had subsequently been added to the north side of the building.\r\nThe chapel was suppressed in 1537 and a grammar school, Queen Elizabeth's Free Grammar and Writing School, was established by letters patent and appears to have occupied the building. The school was to have a master and one under-master and was managed by a board of Governors established by the same letters patent (Manchee 1831, 45). The interior was drawn by James Stewart in 1748 (Bodleian MS.Gough, Somersetshire 2 & 8). Stewart's drawing records two (blocked) pointed arches in north wall; another at east end of south wall, with an ogee-headed opening towards the west, with, in between, a statue (possibly that of Queen Elizabeth now in the church) in an ogee-headed niche. In the east end wall was an eight-light mullion and transom window with, at the north end of the same wall, a fireplace. It had a three-part ceiling with angled sides and flat centre. The visible walls were panelled to height of arch springing.\r\nIn the early 1760s the churchwardens seem to have decided that the \"beauty and magnificence\" of the church were \"greatly impaired and diminished by the situation of the said schoolhouse\" and the decision was taken to remove it. The Governors resolved to move the school into the Lady chapel at the east end of the church on 31 December 1762 (Manchee 1831, 49). The Lady chapel was fitted out as a schoolroom and the Chapel of the Holy Spirit was demolished in 1763 (Dawson 1981, 23)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The old abbey church was taken over as the cathedral and an existing late-medieval building to the south of the Cathedral church was converted into palace (BUAD 789M) for the Bishop. Clergy were accommodated in a number of houses within the precinct of the former abbey.\r\nAt the time of the dissolution Abbot Newland's reconstruction of the nave of the abbey church was unfinished and, the diocese lacking the funds to complete the work, the nave of the cathedral remained truncated until the nineteenth century. Blocking was inserted between the transept walls to form a continuous frontage. The north and south bays of this frontage contained tall arched tracery windows at the extreme ends. The central bay beneath the tower had buttresses which projected west from the frontage. Other alterations were also made to the fabric of the church in the 1540s. The choir screen of the Franciscan friary in Lewin's Mead was purchased and erected in the cathedral. This was later removed. The statutes which established the cathedral required a choir of six minor canons, six lay clerks and six choristers and there was presumably also an organ within the building. By the 1640s the church had an organ by Thomas Dallam, although it is not clear whether this survived the Commonwealth (Spink 1995, 193). However, between 1683 and 1685 the cathedral organist, Thomas Deane, who had been reinstated at the restoration in 1660, was responsible for the installation of a three-manual organ designed by Renatus Harris and constructed by the local organ builder Robert Taunton at a cost of £950 (Spink 1995, 193).\r\nBy the mid-nineteenth century the cathedral was separated from Deanery Road by a low stone wall with iron railings along the top. Works to construct Deanery Road in 1866 also increased access to the north side of the Cathedral by lowering the level of the ground by several feet.\r\nThe nave was reconstructed in the mid nineteenth-century. Designs by G. E. Street were submitted to a public meeting in June 1867. This proposed a nave 117 feet long by 80 feet wide and with twin towers at the west end. The corner stone of the new nave was laid on 17 April 1868 by Lord Limerick, the Provincial Grand Master of the Freemasons \"with grand Masonic ceremony\" according to The Builder (Anon. 1868, 297). The towers of the west end of the new nave were initially roofed above the level of the second stage but the fourth stage was added by the architect John Loughborough Pearson, who designed Truro Cathedral and was also architect to Lincoln Cathedral."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The Square was a private amenity space for the housing which was intended to surround the space.

The buildings of the south side of the Square were built from c.1770 and the east side from 1784. Only half of the west side was actually completed and the north side was only enclosed in 1834 with the construction of the Congregational Chapel designed by William Armstrong.\r\nThe Square was laid out with diagonal cross paths and elm trees planted around the perimeter, although these were felled in 1856. The first edition Ordnance Survey 1:500 Town plan (Bristol sheets LXXI.16.15 and LXXII.13.11) surveyed in 1883 map records open gates at each corner, marked by bollards. At that date the Square was enclosed by railings and there was also a central lamp post. The railings were removed during World War Two.\r\nThe square was vested in Bristol City Council in 1952 and between 1953 and 1954 the Council spent £669 on restoring the lawns and planting of twelve flower beds.

The church was in existence by c1138-1147 when Robert, earl of Gloucester granted it to Turstin as priest (BRO P/St.E/A 1). Latterly the advowson for the rectory belonged to Tewkesbury Abbey which appears to have exercised its right to appoint through its cell St. James Priory (BUAD 1024M). The development of the form of the church is not currently clear but by the late middle ages the church measured 20 metres from north-east to south-west and was 8.5 metres wide. On the north side of the church a tower was attached to the building. The churchyard (BUAD 799M) lay on the north side of the church.\r\nIn October 1399 John Thorp and John Sherp, burgesses of Bristol, gained the agreement of the Crown to establish a chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist in the church and this occupied the south aisle. The same charter also gave them permission to incorporate a fraternity (which later became the Company of Merchant Tailors). The fraternity's book includes an inventory of 1401-02 recording the ornaments of the altar of the chapel, which comprised hangings, vestments of green, gold and ruby and an altar frontal depicting the life of St. John the Baptist (Fox 1880, 13).\r\nAt the dissolution the advowson was acquired by Henry Brayne as part of his purchase of the properties of St. James Priory. The chapel of St. John the Baptist was dissolved in 1547 (Maclean 1883-84, 245) and in 1551 the parish rented the chapel site to the Bristol Corporation to allow the reconstruction and enlargement of the Tolzey (Masters & Ralph, 1967 xiv). In 1637 the tower was rebuilt. The new tower was of two stages with diagonal buttresses and a flat roof. There was a two-centred arch window in north wall of the lower stage. A string course separated the stages.\r\nIn 1657 the Corporation obtained an Act of Parliament to allow it to use the building as a library. The building survived as a parish church, however. The incumbent in the 1730s was Thomas Taylor, described in Bishop Secker's Diocese Book as \"whig, regular, sensible, good\" (McGrath 1985, 36). In 1787 when a further Act of Parliament (28 Geo.III cap. 67) was obtained to merge the parish with Christ Church and to allow demolition of the building. The church was finally demolished in 1820 to enable the construction of Robert Smirke's design for the enlarged Council House (BUAD 342M).\r\nDrawings by Hugh O'Neill made in the 1820s provide some record of the church. He drew the bottom two stages of the tower were drawn in 1820, when it was in use by the Chamberlain for storage of old documents. O'Neill also recorded the demolition of the 1704 Council House (BUAD 341M) and his drawings (Mb2968; Mb2947-Mb2949) show the removal of various parts of the former church, including pointed arches and round-headed and trefoil-headed windows. Architectural fragments were also recovered from the building when it was demolished and O'Neill drew various corbel heads and a boss, in the possession of the antiquarian G. W. Braikenridge or Mr. Garrard the City Chamberlain, in 1822 (M2309-M2312). O'Neill also recorded three fragments of carving, said to be from the old altarpiece in 1823 (Mb14-Mb16)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

After the dissolution of St. James, the advowson of the rectory was acquired by Henry Brayne as part of his purchase of the St. James property in 1544.\r\nBy the late-seventeenth century the church had a tower and spire at, or towards, its eastern end. Nave and two aisles. There was a covered walkway along the Broad Street frontage with a shop on north-west side; arched west doorway with twisted columns. Large traceried west window of 8 lights, one light containing a door at its base, leading to the roof over the pavement. 4-light traceried window to north aisle. Nave and north aisles gabled, crosses to apex of gables. At west end of south aisle a 5-light window with shallow segmental arch, quatrefoil in centre of tracery, above and to the right, in a decorative frame, a large clockface. At the south-west corner of the church, and reaching above the south aisle, a tall thin pillar was topped by a flaming urn. Dragon weathervane atop the spire.\r\nA new organ was built for the church by Renatus Harris in 1708.\r\nThe church was demolished in the late eighteenth century and was rebuilt 1786-1791 to a design by William Paty.

The park extended from Park Row and Whiteladies Road on the west to St. Michael's Hill on the east and the lease had been acquired from the Dean and Chapter of Bristol Cathedral by John Tyndall in the first half of the eighteenth-century. The freehold had subsequently been purchased by Thomas Tyndall who commissioned the construction of Royal Fort House (BUAD 1034M). In 1792 a group of speculative builders headed by T. G. Vaughan persuaded Tyndall to sell part of the surrounding grounds for housing development. Construction work began but the scheme was a casualty of the crash in the property market caused by the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, leaving the park disfigured by foundation trenches (Bettey, 1997 14-15).\r\nThe park subsequently reverted to Tyndall and in February 1799 he engaged Humphry Repton to landscape the site. Repton found Royal Fort House \"surrounded by large chasms in the ground\" and \"immense heaps of earth & broken rock...\" (quoted in Daniels, 1999 238). He proposed retaining the mounds and planting them with trees to screen the house, together with further excavation of the sides of the trenches to lower their edges and create hollows for lawns. Repton's scheme screened nearby housing but preserved views of the more distant city. A watercolour drawing of 1824 showing the western half of the park from Park Place suggests that the park was used for livestock (BUAD 3917; Greenacre and Stoddard, 1988 31).\r\nMuch of the park was developed for housing in the second half of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century.

The chapel is constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble with limestone dressings and is in the Perpendicular Gothic style. It has an aisled nave of five bays with a polygonal chancel.\r\nBy 1862 accommodation within the chapel had become very limited because of housing development in Cotham, but also because of the popularity of the ministry of Rev. David Thomas. E. W. Godwin was commissioned to expand the chapel. Godwin's scheme followed Butterfield's the style of original design closely but used a mix of Pennant sandstone rubble and freestone for the fabric of the walls. His additions included an apse, a cloister and a freestone tower. Godwin also altered the interior, designing a polygonal oak pulpit on a freestone base, an oak screen across the apse to conceal the organ. He also designed a stained glass memorial window for the west end of the chapel, which was made by Joseph Bell (Soros 1999, 138). On the wall of the north-east nave respond there is a monument to Arnold Thomas by Eric Gill. This was executed in 1924 and takes the form of a shepherd and sheep.\r\nThe chapel was bought by the Church of England c1975 and is now Cotham Parish Church.

A fort, known as Windmill Hill fort, was built on the site in 1643 and after the fall of Bristol to the Royalists in that year it was substantially reworked. A Royal order for the work was issued in the summer of 1644 (Cal. S. P. Dom. 1644-1645 235) and it was apparently completed in December of that year. Renamed the Royal Fort, the fort was the most powerful of the city's defensive fortifications during the English Civil Wars (1642-1648).\r\nThere has been some speculation about the exact footprint of the fort but geophysical survey by the University of Southampton in 1999 (BUAD 3479) together with documentary research by Dr. Roger Leech (Leech 2000, 20-21) have suggested a more precise position. The fort occupied the area defined by Royal Fort Road, University Walk, St. Michael's Hill and Tyndall Avenue. It was pentangular in form and the surrounding ditch was approximately 5 metres wide. Both the fortifications and the internal buildings appear to have been of Brandon Hill grit. Little is currently known about the internal organisation of the fort, although a gatehouse (BUAD 131M) in the eastern wall survives at the western end of Royal Fort Road.\r\nThe Royal Fort played a major part in the siege and storming of Bristol by the New Model Army in 1645.\r\nThe site was developed for housing from 1655 (Bettey 1997, 7) and the process of the removal of the fabric of the fort appears to have been gradual. Elements were still extant in the mid-eighteenth century and many of these were recorded in drawings by James Stewart in the 1750s. The Ordnance Survey first edition plan surveyed in 1883 clearly shows part of the north bastion in the garden of Cromwell House.

The site, immediately outside the Marsh Wall (BUAD 1041M) on the east side of the Marsh Gate (BUAD 677M), was leased by the Corporation to John Drewe on 14 March 1493 so that the Guild of Mariners could found a chantry chapel dedicated to St. Clement, the patron saint of mariners (Manchee 1831, 237). Once built, the chapel appears to have been managed by proctors appointed by the Guild and had a one priest who presumably also served the Mariners Almshouse. In addition, as part of the annual rent to the Bristol Corporation for the site the proctors were responsible for managing and maintaining the slip at Hungroad (McGrath 1975, 70).\r\nThe chapel was a rectangular two-storey structure, orientated east-west, with projecting buttresses at the south-west and south-east corners and a pitched roof. The main entrance, a doorway with a four-centred arched opening, was at the centre of the south wall. To the west of the doorway were a pair of tall four-light lancet windows. The fenestration at first-floor level consisted of a two-light lancet window towards the western end of the elevation. There was a second similar window above the entrance. In the eastern half of the elevation there was a pair of four-light mullion and transom windows - possibly inserted during the use of the building as the Merchant Venturers Hall. The organisation of internal space is not currently clear but the internal dimensions were recorded as 67 feet 6 inches [20.66 metres] from east to west by 23 feet [7.04 metres] north-south, the walls being about 2 feet 6 inches [0.77 metres] to 3 feet [0.92 metres] in thickness (Pritchard 1907, 226-227).\r\nThe chapel was presumably dissolved in 1547-1548 along with the Guild of Mariners. The site was granted to Sir Ralph Sadleir and Lawrence Winnyngton by the Crown on 15 December 1550, and Sadleir and Winnyngton subsequently sold the site to Edward Prynne. His heir, Erasmus Prynne, sold the site to Thomas Aldworthe and Thomas Symonds (Manchee 1831, 237) who were apparently acting for the Society of Merchant Venturers. The Society used the chapel as its hall and also took over responsibility for the Mariner's Almshouse. The building appears essentially to have been retained by the Society and, despite remodelling of the exterior, the core of the building seems to have survived as the southern element of the Merchant Venturers Hall until the early-twentieth century. The remains of the chapel were recorded in 1907 in the lower storey of the hall (Pritchard 1907, 226-227). Air raids struck the hall on 2 December 1940, causing extensive damage.

The Lamb Inn had been established on the site by 1586 (BRO 00347(5)) and was then or lately in the tenure of John Austine, saddler. In 1626 the foeffees of the Whitson Lands granted a lease to John Bradway with a convenant to allow rebuilding. In 1670 the inn was held by Thomas Biggs and probate inventories made at the time of his death in 1677 and his wife's death in 1687 record the rooms and their contents. The inventory for Biggs mentions fifteen rooms for accommodation, kitchen and buttery, and brewhouse (George & George 2005, 80-85). Ten years later the arrangement of the rooms was essentially the same, with additionally a cellar, stables and turret recorded (George & George 2005, 156-160). In 1698 the inn was leased to Onesiphorous Tyndall with the requirement to spend £200 on the building. In 1700 two stables and the rooms over them were purchased from Bradway by Tyndall (Leech 1997, 197).\r\nWhen it was drawn in 1823 (BRSMG M2357; M2358), the building was a gabled, jettied house of three storeys and attic with a three-window range. It was of probable seventeenth-century date, and the façade presumably dated mainly to the rebuilding by Tyndall. The ground floor was largely occupied by a shopfront with a central entrance and windows on its east and west sides. At the west end of the façade at ground floor there was a gabled porch with carving below gable covering an entrance with fretwork gates. At first-floor level there was a wide canted bay with ten lights, and one light to each end. The jettied second floor was supported by a bracket at its eastern end. The fenestration comprised three six by six pane sash windows. The gable end was hung with slates or tiles and at the centre there was a six-light transomed window under a drip-moulding. The gabled roof was pantiled. Evidence for the interior of the building comes from a drawing made by Hugh O'Neill in 1823 during demolition of the building. The eastern wall of the building is all that remains and this is supported by long timber props. Seventeenth-century, or earlier, fireplaces are recorded in the western wall of the building (towards its northern end) at ground-, first- and second-floor levels. A number of doors and sections of panelling are shown propped against the wall.\r\nThe porch is likely to have led to the stables and rooms to the rear of the main building. Latterly it appears to have served a building at the rear, probably No.51 Wine Street. In notes accompanying a painting by O'Neill made before demolition (BRSMG M2357) G. W. Braikenridge records that \"under the Porch late the Warehouse of Messrs. Holland Jackson & Schimmelpenning Dry Salters was formerly the Lamb Inn .... & the House has from the arrangement of the Rooms all the appearance of having been built for an Inn\" (Notes, B7). The warehouse was listed at No.51 Wine Street in the 1819 Bristol directory."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building was constructed c.1588 as one of two lodges to the gardens of the Sir John Yonge's Great House (BUAD 420M) in St. Augustine's Back which extended from Trenchard Street across Stony Hill. The building was of three-storeys with a cross-gabled roof and a turret on the west side. In plan it measured 8 metres from south-west to north-east and was 6.8 metres wide. The south-east facing elevation had a two-window range with two gables. At ground floor the fenestration consisted of a four-light window. There was a three-light window at first-floor level and a two-light window in the attics. All of the windows had stone hood moulds above. The south-west facing elevation had a single gable, small windows lighting the attic and a single-flue chimneystack at the apex of the gable. The turret at the north--west corner of the building was octagonal with crenellations around the top and contained a spiral stair. There was another chimneystack at the centre of the roof. The main entrance to the building appears to have been at the western end of the north-west facing elevation. This led to into a lobby which gave on to the stair in the turret and the three ground-floor rooms, two on the south side of the building and the third at the north-east corner. In the corner of one of the rooms there was a stone chimney-piece bearing the date 1588. Above was a pair of compasses surmounted by a dove carrying an olive branch in its beak (Braikenridge Notes A32).\r\nThe antiquarian G. W.

The windmill was constructed c1670 and late-nineteenth and twentieth century photographs and cartography indicate it was a circular tower of coursed rubble, approximately 5.2 metres in diameter. Millerd's 1670 map of Bristol and Jean Rocque's 1742 map depict it as a tower mill with four sails. Millerd's prospect of the city of 1673 and that by the Bucks in 1734, on the other hand, seem to suggest that it was a post mill (Bryant, 2000).\r\nAccording to Latimer the windmill was leased by William Hulme of Mary-le-port Street and converted into a snuff mill in 1754. Hulme went bankrupt in 1757 and the site, by then part of the Cotham Lodge estate, was bought by Sydenham Teast in 1772 (BRO 40376 Bundle 1). Teast sold the land to Charles Partridge the same year, the legal documents describing the property as \"all that Windmill situate in a Close of Meadow or Pasture Ground called Windmill Close together with all other Buildings standing near thereto. And also All that the said Close of ground called Windmill Close now in the Occupation of Thomas Evans and Company.\"\r\nLatimer states that the mill was rebuilt as a prospect tower in the base of the windmill in 1779 (Latimer, 1887 296) although the degree of reconstruction is unknown. There was an arched entrance at ground level and ogee-headed sash windows evenly spaced around the top of the tower. The structure also had mock arrowloop openings and crenellations around the top. The window openings were edged in brick and \"loopholes\" at the foot of the tower were edged in slag blocks, suggesting that all of these features dated to the conversion of the mill to a prospect tower. It was associated with Cotham Lodge to the east until that building was demolished in 1846. After this it formed part of the grounds of Tower House, occupied by Francis Fry.\r\nThe tower fell into disrepair in the twentieth century, and it and Hartfield House were acquired for the extension of the playing fields of Cotham Grammar School in the early 1950s by which time the tower had been listed (Grade III). This did not prevent demolition however, and the tower was removed during the summer of 1953 (Bryant, 2000)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The house was located at the foot of St. Michael's Hill, on the eastern side of St. Michael's Hill. It was founded by Eva, wife of Robert, FitzHarding in 1173 (Graham in Page 1907, 93) and endowed with land in Southmead (apparently the manor of Southmead).\r\nThe layout and extent of the nunnery has not been established. The precinct appears to have been defined on the eastern and southern sides by Upper Maudlin Street and St. Michael's Hill, although its northern and western boundaries are less clear.\r\nThe church consisted of a nave and three aisles with four arches and William Worcestre, writing in 1480, gives the (probably internal) length of the church as approximately 15 metres (Neale 2000, 228-229). The church seems to have stood on Upper Maudlin Street and Dr. Roger Leech suggests that the tower of the church, which is mentioned in the post-dissolution sale documents, may have been located at the junction of St. Michael's Hill and Upper Maudlin Street (Longman 2001, 6-7). The burial ground for the nunnery probably lay immediately to the north-west of the church but the spatial organisation of the ancillary buildings is currently unknown. In the mid-fourteenth century St. Augustine's Abbey granted the nunnery four adjacent houses (Fry 1910, 368) although it is not clear whether this represented an enlargement of the precinct.\r\nThe house was dissolved in late-June or early-August 1536. The site was sold by the Crown to the London merchant Henry Brayne, who had also acquired St. James Priory (BUAD 1024M), and the priory buildings appear then to have been used as a residence (Longman 2001, 4-5). The manor of Southmead, including the wood known as Magdalene Wood, were sold to Richard Andrews of Hayles (Gairdner & Brodie 1880, 76).\r\nPart of one of the buildings of the nunnery on Upper Maudlin Street seems to have still been extant in the latter part of the nineteenth-century and was by then the King David Inn. Internal and external photographs (published by Winstone) and drawings by James Stewart in 1751, T. L. Rowbotham in 1828 (BRSMG M2562) and Samuel Loxton in the early twentieth century (Bristol Reference Library M948 and M950) of these buildings exist.\r\nThe King David Inn was demolished in the early twentieth century and the present building erected. Part of the site was archaeologically investigated in 2000 and 2001 (BUAD 3591; BUAD 3617; BUAD 3934) when structural elements of the medieval nunnery and inhumations probably associated with the burial ground were recorded."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The inn occupied the site of two buildings during the Middle Ages. The northern of these was a dwelling first recorded in 1295. An inn called \"le Hart\" had been established there by 1442 and it was then occupied by Martin Whyte. The southern tenement may have been incorporated into the inn by 1438.\r\nThe fifteenth and sixteenth century form of the inn is currently unknown. The buildings appear to have been refronted in the seventeenth century but remained architecturally legible as two structures. The southern building was a four-storey, two-bay jettied house. The ground floor was occupied by a shop front. The jettied first floor was supported by a large pillar at the south end of the frontage and that part of the frontage was recessed to form an entrance porch. The first floor had two bay windows with sash on the south side of the southern of these. There was a two-light large casement in the south face of the building where it projected forward of the next door property. The second floor was also jettied and had a similar arrangement of windows except that the narrow sash window in the south face of the building had only a single light. The third floor was similar although there was no casement in the south face of the building. Full width pentices divided the first and second, and second and third, floors. The roof contained small attic dormers. The northern building was a four-storey, three-bay jettied building. The building had a classical frontage with tall sashes. The jettied first floor overhung the footway and contains twelve over twelve-pane sash windows, while those of the second and third floors had eight over eight-pane sashes. Above each of the first-floor windows there were segmental-arched pediments, while above the second floor sashes there were standard pediments. The eaves of the roof projected well forward of the frontage of the building. The inn sign, a recumbent white hart, was located on the southern house set on a curved support projecting from the centre of the frontage above the ground floor.\r\nSomething of the internal form of the inn was recorded in a probate inventory of 1650. This records ten guest rooms, as well as the parlour, a hall which also contained the \"little Buttery\", the kitchen and a room for the maid (George & George 2002, 166-182). The inn was then leased by George Pearce.\r\nThe Quaker James Naylor stopped at the inn after riding into Bristol on a donkey on Palm Sunday in 1656 (Thomas 1971, 257).\r\nThe building was demolished in the mid-1860s to allow the construction of the Grand Hotel (BUAD 1667M)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The hospital was founded in the later-twelfth century and is known to have been in existence by 1186. There is some uncertainty over the precise location and extent of the hospital. Dr. Roger Leech argues, from post-medieval documentary and cartographic evidence, that the hospital precinct was defined by Jones Lane on the south and west sides and Redcliff Pit on the east. The land parcels of Nos.71-74 represent a post-medieval subdivision of the precinct (Leech pers comm.). Jones Lane itself may have originated as a slipway to the river for the hospital.\r\nThe community appears to have contained both sexes. Some of the early documents relating to the hospital refer to \"brethren and sisters\" and in 1317 Bishop Drokensford of Bath and Wells asked the master to accept the niece of Edmund de Wyntereshall as a secular sister (Scott Holmes, T. Religious Houses in Page 1969, 160).\r\nThe form of the hospital is uncertain but William Worcestre indicates that it had a church and cloister. His measurements suggest that both were of a relatively modest size (Neale 2000, 248-249). The water supply of the hospital was delivered via a feather from the Redcliffe pipe which ran across Redcliff Hill (Hobhouse 1887, 145) to discharge into a square pool or cistern at the centre of the cloister (Neale 2000, 248-249). A hermitage (BUAD 627M) was established in Redrock Garden to the west of the church in the fourteenth century. The hospital also took over responsibility for the Chapel of the Holy Spirit (BUAD 925M) in the churchyard of St. Mary Redcliff in the thirteenth century. In addition it owned the advowson of the rectory of Butcome and the vicarage of Backwell (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 286).\r\nThe hospital was at the centre of some controversy at the beginning of the fifteenth-century because of allegations of Lollardy in the Hospital and mismanagement by the then prior, John Seyntpoull. A commission was appointed in 1404 to investigate the charges (Hudson 1988, 122n) and in 1411 the goods and estates of the hospital were sequestered by the Crown (Scott Holmes 1914, lx-lxi; 80; 83-84). By 1442 there was apparently only one brother in residence (Scott Holmes, T. Religious Houses in Page 1969, 160).\r\nThe hospital was surrendered to the Crown by the master, Richard Bromefield, in early March 1544 and the site, and much of the associated property, was sold in two lots to Dr. George Owen, physician to Henry VIII and a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in April of that year on condition that he funded the salary and accommodation of a resident priest to preach in the city on eight occasions each year (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 93; 286). The buildings were apparently demolished soon after Owen's acquisition of the site (Latimer 1901, 176-177)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building was a substantial house belonging to the merchant William Canynges (1402-1474). It stood on a plot of land approximately 70 metres in length between Redcliff Street and the River Avon which was first developed in the twelfth century (Jones 1986, 7-8). It is not clear how much of the house was built for Canynges in the mid-fifteenth century and how much was an existing building.\r\nThe form of the house as a whole is uncertain but at the east end, close to Redcliff Street, there was a hall with cusped arch-brace roof trusses supported on carved corbels (although \"Many of the Corbels in the Chapel were purchased by the late Mr. Birtill of Mr. Steele the Mason in St. Thomas Street & came originally from the Old Church of St. Thomas Bristol\" (Braikenridge notes)). This part of the building was constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble and was 0.58 metres thick. At the west end of the wall were two blind segmental-headed arches with freestone mouldings. The western arch was 5 metres wide, while the eastern was narrower, spanning 3.60 metres and contained an ogee-headed piscina or stoup (BUAD 999A; BRSMG M2045). The hall had panelling to head height and galleries at first-floor level along the south and east sides. Mr. Lazarus Birtill discovered a fresco on the west wall after he had purchased the building in the early-nineteenth century, and this was retouched in 1805 by a Mr.Young, one of Birtill's relations. A small gothic doorway led into a room, possibly a parlour, on the west side of the hall. This had a floor of encaustic or slip over stamp tiles of probable mid-fifteenth century date.\r\nAbove the hall there was a tower described by William Worcestre, writing in 1480, as measuring 60 feet (18.4 metres) by 48 feet (14.7 metres) with four highly decorated bay windows. Worcestre also indicates that the internal decoration was rich (Neale 2000, 214-215) and the roof of the hall is known to have had a painted and gilded decorative scheme. The house also contained a private chapel after 1454 (Sherbourne 1985, 15).\r\nCanynge's House appears to have been subdivided into three properties in the post-medieval period. The hall appears had carved benches fixed to the south and west walls in the second half of the seventeenth century. The building was considerably altered in the 1820s. The hall was \"dismantled\" in 1821-1822, when the altarpiece in the chapel was removed, and converted to a warehouse which was occupied in 1822 by Mr. Thomas Chamberlain, a brush- and mop-maker. In 1826 the property was owned by Richard Badham of the Champion of Wales public house on Broad Quay, and in the tenure of William Naish, straw bonnet maker as recorded by Sun Fire Insurance Policy 1046624. The policy also records that bleaching was carried out within the property (BUAD 1146).\r\nThe medieval roof of the hall survived until 1937, when the front of the building was removed for road widening. The pavement of medieval tiles was removed to the British Museum. The medieval arches in the north wall survive in situ as part of the freestanding boundary wall of Nos.1-6 Guild Court, Redcliff Backs. Recording of the surviving medieval elements of the building began in the 1820s when several watercolour drawings of the interior were made. Part of the medieval roof of the hall was drawn by Dollman in the 1850s (Dollman & Jobbins 1863) and the main body of the hall was photographed c1910 (Winstone 1957, pl.105) and by Philip Street in 1933 (BUAD 2346-2349). The site of the house was archaeologically excavated in 1983-85 (BUAD 447; Jones 1986) and the standing north wall of the ground-floor hall was recorded by Roger Pryce in 1972 (BUAD 667) and by R. H.

In 1451 John Wylly, a brewer, occupied the southern house and by 1475 it was occupied by William Bruer. These names imply that brewing was probably taking place. A document of 1495 confirms that a brewhouse was present of the site and that an inn or tavern known as the \"herteshorne\" had been established (Leech 1997, 106).\r\nThe building was refronted (and possibly rebuilt) in the seventeenth-century.

The building was a three-storey, two-bay house of probable mid seventeenth-century date and occupied a plot measuring 14.25 metres east-west by 5 metres north to south. The main elevation faced south-east on to Pithay. The ground floor was apparently a shopfront with a central entrance doorway. A full-width pentice roof, apparently covered with slates, divided ground from first-floor. The upper floors of the east end of the building extended over Tower Lane, forming a frontage 7.5 metres wide at first-floor level on Pithay. The fenestration at first and second floors consisted of continuous twin bays with panelling in the base and Ipswich windows above. The bays were apparently roofed with lead. The divison between the floors was marked by a moulded string course and between the second-floor windows is the arms of the Brewers' Company moulded in plasterwork. Immediately above there was a sunburst decoration. At attic level in the centre of the elevation there was a smaller bay which rested on the corners of the second-floor bays and contained an Ipswich window. Above the bay, immediately beneath the apex of the eaves there was a sunburst decoration. The side, south-west facing, elevation on Tower Lane had a window opening on Tower Lane and there was a rainwater downpipe immediately to the east of this. The building has a gabled pantile roof with a cross-gable on the southern part of the roof only. There was apparently only a single purlin on each side of the main roof.\r\nThe early history of the building is currently unknown but presumably during the late eighteenth- and early-nineteenth centuries the building was used as a Spunging House. In 1829 G. W. Braikenridge noted that the building was \"formerly used to lock up Persons when first arrested for Debt & [was] called the Spunging House\" (Notes, M82). A watercolour painting of that year in the Braikenridge Collection of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery executed by T. L. Rowbotham (BRSMG M2373) records the building and shows a painted signboard bearing the legend \"CUMMINS/UPHOLSTERER\" over the entry to Tower Lane. Cummins is listed as an upholsterer at No.1 Pithay in contemporary street directories. The painting also shows many trunks and coats displayed outside the building, suggesting that the ground-floor shop may have been used for the trade in ready-made or second-hand clothes.\r\nThe building was demolished in March 1898 according to John Pritchard (Pritchard 1900-03, 259) but a photograph by T. Protheroe at the end of the 1890s (BUAD 2651) shows the remains of the northern party wall.

A building stood on the site from at least the mid sixteenth century when it was the tenement of Richard Mallett (Leech 1997, 197). The building as recorded in 1823 was a gabled, jettied house of three storeys and attic which was of seventeenth-century date. The main, north-east facing, elevation of the building was almost entirely panelled. The ground floor consisted of a shopfront with a central entrance doorway and a bay window on either side, and the door of a cellar access shute was located below the western window. The first floor had full-width transomed glazing with bay windows at the eastern and western ends of the elevation. The second floor had a decorative strip at the base and there was transomed glazing across the full-width. At the centre of the elevation there was an oriel window, with six lights to the front, and two to the ends. There were five decorative brackets below the sills, including one in the oriel. There was also an oriel at attic level, containing four lights to the front and two to the ends. There was a bracket carved into a figure supporting the sill. The eaves were supported by decorative brackets and had carved bargeboards. The glazing to the first and second floors extended on to both returns by a light. There was a tall chimneystack in the western wall of the building.\r\nThe section of the side, west facing, elevation exposed where the building projected forward of those on either side was rendered and had no windows or other openings. The north-east facing elevation had panelling at ground-, first- and second-floor. To the rear of the building there was a tall, five-storey, structure. This had a lean-to pantile roof with a doorway at the eastern end and above there were small leaded casement windows. At the east end there was a stair tower leading on to a flat roof with a rail or balustrade on its northern side. The function of this is not clear, although it may have been a small viewing platform. Adoining the south side of this structure there was a small tower-like structure with a pitched roof. Beneath the eaves of this on the east side there was a small window, possibly a casement.\r\nIn 1823 the building was occupied by Crisps Boot and Shoe Manufactory but George Weare Braikenridge's notes accompanying a drawing made that year record that the building was \"now taking down to rebuild\" (Braikenridge Notes, C103).

The building was constructed in the thirteenth century with additions in the fourteenth century. Relatively little is currently known about the form of the Great Hall as a whole. The surviving Vaulted Chambers, probably part of the entrance to the building, is constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble with limestone ashlar detailing and consists of two adjoining rectangular chambers with quadripartite ribbed vaults, though the ribs of the two cells have different profiles, indicating that they do not belong to the same phase of construction. The structure appears to have been described by William Worcester in the early 1480s who notes it was 10 yards long, \"with an arched vault above the entrance of the great hall\" (Neale 2000, 238-239).\r\nThe building was one of the elements of Bristol Castle which survived its demolition in 1657-1658. It was incorporated into a new large house on the east side of Tower Street which is recorded by James Millerd's 1673 plan of Bristol. By the 1820s the building was owned by the Feoffees of the Baptist Society and let to a Mr. Gould (Braikenridge Notes A.29+ and A.29++). Samuel Seyer published a plan and view of the interior (Seyer 1821, 384-386) when the surviving medieval elements were largely the same as the currently existing plan. The interior of the building was recorded in three watercolour drawings by Hugh O'Neill in 1821 (BRSMG M2731 to M2733) and a seventeenth-century stair with carved newels and balusters and pendant newels at first floor survived beyond the north end of the building, a stair which is likely to have dated to the original conversion of the building into a house in the late 1650s or early 1660s. A drawing of the following year by Samuel Jackson (BRSMG M2734) recorded the Tower Street elevation, including a four-centred arched entrance containing a panelled door dating to the seventeenth-century and a pair of stepped buttresses. Gould removed the stepped buttresses on 21 October 1822 and the work was drawn in progress by Jackson (BRSMG M2735). By the late-nineteenth century the northern half of the building had been subdivided by the insertion of a stud partition. The seventeenth century stair was also extant at this date but was subsequently removed. By 1920 the building formed of No.21 Tower Street, then Sealey Brothers confectionery shop. Sealey Brothers inserted a new suspended floor in the southern half of the building, possibly after removal of a vaulted undercroft. The shop was let to Boots the Chemist in the 1930s which rebuilt the façade, and also appears to have been responsible for breaking through the eastern bays. The vaults were scheduled in 1936-37. The shop was bombed in November 1940 (Warne 1943, 7) and the building gutted. The medieval vaulted arches survived largely intact, though the limestone apparently suffered some heat damage from the associated fire. Some emergency repairs were made to stabilise the structure. The building was subject to Compulsory Purchase by the Bristol Corporation in 1951 but seems to have remained empty until the building was restored in 1974 by the architect Alan Rome (who made an initial measured survey of the building in 1970 (BUAD 3187)). As part of the work the floor was removed and relaid in concrete with an underfloor heating system. An extension was built at the north end of the building in the early 1980s, its site being archaeologically excavated in advance (BUAD 3096), and remedial works were also undertaken in 1993-1994 by the architect John Winstone.\r\nThe building is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Monument no.

It was a Chantry chapel founded by Thomas Knape, a former mayor of Bristol who died in 1404. Two priests were to be maintained in perpetuity to perform daily service and pray for the souls of Knape and his wife Agnes. In his will Knape directed that he should be buried in the chancel of the chapel (Wadley 1886, 68), suggesting that the building may have been complete, or at least close to completion, at the time of his death. The chapel occupied a plot between Welsh Back and Queen Charlotte Street. The north side was defined by Crow Lane and a plan of 1850 (BRO Plan Book C fo.98a) suggests that there may also have been a lane between Queen Charlotte Street and Welsh Back on the south side of the chapel. The form of the building and its position within the plot is currently unknown.\r\nA survey of the Chantries of Bristol of February 1547/8 (BUAD 2591) found that there was then only one incumbent David Thomas who was then 51 years of age, had \"noe other livinge or p[ro]mocion\" and received £6 per annum.

The chapel, a chapel at ease of St Nicholas, was apparently founded using the gifts of several members of the Fraternity of the Assumption of Our Lady (Maclean 1883-84, 239-240) including the burgess Elias Spelly (Neale 2002, 142-143) and lay within the parish of St. Nicholas. William Worcestre gives the dedication date of the chapel as 4th February (Neale 2002, 166-167) and, in addition to funding clerics to perform masses on Saturdays and distributing alms to the poor, revenue from the endowments were to be used to fund the maintenance and repair of Bristol Bridge (Maclean 1883-84, 239-240).\r\nThe chapel was constructed of stone and appears to have been orientated from south-west to north-east across the width of the bridge. There was a large vehicular arch to allow traffic to pass beneath the building. The main description of the structure comes from William Worcestre, who visited it in the early 1480s (BUAD 3601; 3602). He noted that it was 25 yards long and 7 wide (Neale 2000, 2-3) with a square, four-stage stone bell tower \"on the left [in sinistra]\" of the chapel which was reputed to have been built c1460 (Neale 2000, 142-143; 150-151). Worcestre gives the height of the tower as 15 fathoms from ground-level to the bell-chamber \"measured by the bell ropes\" (Neale 2000, 142-143) and the bells were still present in the 1540s (Maclean 1883-84, 239-240). The fenestration comprised four large windows on each side and a \"high\" window above the main altar. One or more of the chapel windows contained stained glass depicting the founders from the Fraternity of the Assumption and their wives (Neale 2000, 142-143). Beneath the building there was a \"beautiful\" large crypt which, Worcestre notes, accommodated the councillors and officers of the town and was used for public meetings about the town's business (Neale, 2000 12-13). Half of the roof was leaded according to the survey made in 1547 (Maclean 1883-84, 239-240).\r\nThe internal organisation of the building is less clear, but in addition to the crypt Worcestre mentions the chapel, a hall with offices and an upper room and highest room (Neale 2002, 166-167) - the latter two presumably being spaces in the tower. There was also a smaller chapel with an altar to the east of the main altar and Worcestre states that this was three yards long (Neale 2000, 166-167).\r\nThe chapel was dissolved in 1547 and was purchased by the Corporation in 1548 for £40 which then rented it out as a warehouse. In 1649 Walter Stephens, draper, was ordered to repair the arch of the former building over the highway which was in a dangerous state (Latimer, 1900 224). The building survived into the mid-eighteenth century, although the tower is not visible in a view of the bridge of c1760 (BUAD 3321) perhaps suggesting that this element had already been removed. The chapel seems to have been demolished in the 1760s, at the same time that the rest of the medieval bridge was removed."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The second medieval property had apparently been incorporated into the White Lion by this date.\r\nThe sixteenth-century form of the building is currently unclear, but it was apparently refronted in the seventeenth century. It was a four-storey jettied building with a six-window range and a pitched roof. The ground floor had a plain frontage with a band of casement windows at around shoulder height. The first floor was jettied over the footway. The first and second floors contained sash windows at the north side of each bay. Above the windows were pediments which were segmental in the second and fifth bays. The sashes at third floor did not have pediments. The frontage had pargetting forming a brick pattern. Beneath each of the first floor sashes was a small square of raised plasterwork with a circle in the centre and a quartered background.\r\nBy 1740 the inn was leased by James Bowyer, innholder, and Joseph Sheppard, saddler. In the 1760s and 1770s the White Lion was owned by Thomas Lawrence, father of the portrait painter Sir Thomas Lawrence R.A. (1769-1830). The White Lion Club, active in support of the Tory party in elections in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, took its name from the inn where it met.\r\nThe building was demolished in the mid-1860s to allow the construction of the Grand Hotel (BUAD 1667M)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

A building seems to have stood on the site from at least 1295 when William Scoche is recorded as the occupier and in 1384, when it was purchased by John Stanys the property comprised three shops with a cellar beneath. A document of 1437 records the property as a messuage, cellar, solar and garden held by Margaret Asscheley (Leech 1997, 46). By 1543 the property had been acquired by the feoffees of All Saints parish and a lease of that year to Lewes Robyns, skinner, mentions a stable at the end of the plot. In 1598 the feoffees sold the building to the executors of Robert Kitchen who created a shambles known as Newmarket Passage. It is not clear what works this entailed but some reconstruction of the building was certainly undertaken. The building seems to have oversailed the south-western end of Newmarket Passage and a timber beam spanning the centre of the Passage had a carved inscription along the whole length of its south-west face reading \"THIS BUILDING IS AT THE CHARGE OF ROBART KITCH[EN] / ALDERMAN OF BRISTOL FOR THE RELIEFE OF THE POOR.\" At the centre of the beam is a shield bearing a monogram , probably \"RK\", with the date 1598 below (BUAD 4265; BRSMG Mb6934).\r\nThe building appears to have been refronted in the seventeenth century and by the early 1860s was a four-storey, single-bay jettied building with a shopfront at ground floor level and bay sash windows at first and second floors. It had a smaller sash at third floor (Winstone 1972, plates 17-18).

The churchyard was the burial ground for the parish of St. James and was in use from the medieval period until the 1850s. It also served several other parishes during its lifetime, including St. John until the late fifteenth-century. The churchyard was located on the south side of the parish church, (the nave of the priory church). It was bounded on the north by the priory (although it extended in front of part of the west end of the church, aligned with the original south-west corner, slightly to the north of what is now the western part of St. James Parade) and on the east by a street known as St. James Churchyard (whose line survives as the passage along the east end of the John Lewis department store). The southern boundary was the Horsefair, and the western approximately Lower Maudlin Street. Excavation at the west front of St. James's Church in 1994-1995 (BUAD 3156) found that the northern edge of the churchyard had been moved southward, probably when the south aisle was added (perhaps c.1374), and houses (Nos.14-18) built on the site. The churchyard was not enclosed until 1813.\r\nThe internal arrangement of the churchyard is less well understood. William Worcestre describes a small, square freestone chapel in the churchyard. A path, shown on Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol, ran diagonally across the churchyard. The inhumations in the churchyard have been shown by archaeological excavation in three locations to have been laid in north-south rows with individual burials orientated east-west. No brick burial shafts or vaults have been recorded in the churchyard to date (14/11/98).\r\nThe churchyard was the site of the annual St. James Fair (illustrated by Miss Bird in 1825 (BRSMG Mb2)). The churchyard was subdivided to create a Hay and Coal Market in the south-east part in 1838 and part of the south-western corner was removed for street improvements during the century.\r\nBy the 1850s was found to be full and was closed to burials by an Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852. In 1880 the parochial authorities converted the churchyard into a public park and laid it out with seats, shrubberies and winding paths, which are shown by the Ordnance Survey 1:500 maps of the early 1880s. The surviving two parts of the churchyard are still in use as a public park, the easternmost containing the remains of a calvary cross (BUAD 94M). \r\nThe boundary walls, railings, piers and gates are listed Grade II (No.955), with the walls, gates and railings around the small area of churchyard to the north of the Parade listed Grade II (No.954).

Externally, the ground floor comprised an arcade and the main entrance was at the centre between shops. There was a public house near the western end, beyond which was a side access to the theatre. The stage was 107 feet (32.7 metres) wide and the proscenium arch 30 feet (9.18 metres) by 25 feet 6 inches (7.8 metres).

The theatre was the scene of a serious accident on Boxing Day 1869, when eighteen of the audience were trampled to death.\r\nIn 1902 there were extensive alterations to the theatre by Frank Matcham. Externally these included the creation of a glazed entrance porch with a cast iron frame to enclose the main entrance and the addition of four statues (Tragedy, Comedy, Music and Dance) were added to the parapet. Inside the theatre the floors were angled to make the seating raked, the boxes were remodelled, foyers, smoking rooms and lounges added and the decorative scheme altered to cream and gold. Electric lighting was also added throughout the building (Carleton 1983, 16). The theatre was refurbished again in 1931 when the architect A. E.

The town gate was constructed as part of the second circuit of the town wall (BUAD 1040M) in the thirteenth century and stood in Broad Weir, at its junction with Peter Street and Wine Street. It appears to have directly replaced the earlier Aldgate or Old Gate (BUAD 34M), which was 82 metres to the south-west along Wine Street.\r\nThe form of the gate in medieval period is currently unclear. William Worcestre, writing in the 1480s, records the gate as 9 yards long by 4 yards wide (Neale 2000, 250-251) and notes that there was a large cellar beneath it (Neale 2000, 12-13). It appears to have had a drum towers on at least the eastern sides (BRSMG M2718) and was likely to have been of two storeys, with a room above the gate. At first-floor on the north-east facing elevation there was a cross-window at the north-western side with a trefoil-headed window under a gable top towards the centre of the elevation. The jambs of this window comprised clasped shafts.\r\nFrom c1426 until the middle of the century a grammar school was held in the room over the gate. The master was Robert Londe and the curriculum of the school, indicated by a manuscript of teaching materials copied \"at Bristol, above the New Gate\" by Thomas Short (Oxford, Lincoln College MS lat.129) who may have been a senior pupil, derived from Oxford (Orme 1976, 38-40). Londe died in February 1462 but it is not clear whether the school continued to be held after his death. However, it had disappeared by 1480 (Neale 2000, 28-29).\r\nThe gate was still extant seventeenth century and formed part of Bristol's defences in the civil war of 1642-1646 when a falcon, a cannon which fired a shot weighing 2 pounds, was sited on it (Roy 1975, 261). Subsequently the gate appears to have been incorporated into the structure of Newgate prison (BUAD 439M) and a second storey was added, possibly around the time of the construction of the prison.

The inhumation cemetery was an extension burial ground belonging to St. Nicholas Parish. The plot was formerly the site of the Chapel of St. John the Evangelist (BUAD 42M) and the parish seems to have acquired it in 1548 after the dissolution of the chapel, since a deed of that year refers to the site as the cemetery of St. Nicholas parish (Leech 1997, 168). The earliest cartographic record of the cemetery is James Millerd's map of 1673. It is also recorded by watercolour paintings dating to the early 1820s in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery (BRMSG M2238 (BUAD 1360) & BRSMG M2279 (BUAD 1378)).\r\nThe cemetery was enclosed by a stone wall, and entrance was from Welsh Back via a set of steps at the south end of the wall fronting the Back. The entrance had a semi-circular arched head with a ball finial above and panelled jambs. Roque's map of 1742 shows an open-fronted, roofed structure on the outside, along the entire length of the Welsh Back frontage. A structure, possibly a form of lych gate, stood immediately inside the entrance in the nineteenth-century. This was essentially a pyramidal pantiled roof, with a ball finial in the centre, which was open on its west side. Its western corners were supported by columns and its eastern corners probably by the perimeter wall. Use of the burial ground appears from the painting of 1823 (BRSMG 2279) to have been dense. The burial ground was closed for interment by an Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852.\r\nThe site was subsequently used as a children's play area until this was closed in 1902 (Latimer 1970, 4). The site was then built over. The site of the cemetery now lies mainly under Crow Lane but also extends beneath the Telephone House site. Crow Lane was widened (apparently in two stages) and the northern two-thirds of the burial ground lie beneath it. It is not known whether the inhumations have been removed from the site, but the Home Office has no record of any licence for the removal of human remains being granted (J. R. Brett pers. comm.).

The site is known to have been bequeathed by Alice Hailes to All Saints' Church in 1261. The feoffees borrowed money to build an inn or tavern known as the \"Grene Lates\" between 1439 and 1442 and the building was still known as the Green Lattice in 1653 (Leech, 1997). The tavern was one of the row of houses at the northern end of High Street known during the medieval period as Cooks Row, which sold take-away food to those without the means to cook for themselves. Entries in the accounts of the churchwardens of All Saints for 1475 and 1488 record construction work to the building, particularly to the kitchen (Burgess, 2000 84-85; 120). The form of the medieval building has not been completely established but it consisted of a cellared single-bay house with a detached kitchen separated by an open yard to the rear. Part of the medieval arch windbrace roof of the kitchen (drawn by George Pryce in 1850 (BUAD 3044; Pryce, 1850)) survives, as do two cellars of medieval date beneath the site. The roof of the front, east, cellar is of 5 inch square joists supported on 11 inch square transverse oak joists. The rear, west, cellar has a vaulted stone roof, with an original opening lined with freestone blocks. The walls of the cellar are of coursed rubble bonded in a red mortar with lime inclusions. In the south-west corner is a shute again lined with freestone blocks which, it was thought, might have been part of a garderobe for the floor above (Leech, 1999).\r\nThe facade of the house was replaced in the seventeenth century and this was painted by Hugh O'Neill in 1823 (BUAD 1419: Braikenridge Collection, BRSMG M2387). The view shows that the new front was jettied and the roof was gabled. There were shop windows either side of central entrance, a light above the doorway and cellar access under the south window. The glazing at first-floor was full-width and included a central bay with an Ipswich window. There was a roofed oriel or bay at second-floor, with 16/24 pane sash to the front and 6/9 to the side. The four-light attic window had no transom. The bargeboards had carved decoration. George Weare Braikenridge notes that in 1823 the building was known as The Sign of the Three Blackbirds, although a Mr. Stockdale and his son had carried on their woollen drapery business there for many years and it was then occupied by John, Joseph and Benjamin Davies, woollen warehouse.\r\nIn June 1825 the building was again re-fronted, the new facade being of limestone ashlar in a late-Georgian Greek Revival style having been taken to afford access to the Rummer Tavern in All Saints Lane (Braikenridge Notes, C.30). The building is of two storeys and attic with a two-window range and a hipped mansard roof. The shop front dates to the twentieth century and has right-hand doorway and plate-glass window.\r\nNo.41 High Street was surveyed by Dr. Roger Leech and the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England in 1997 (BUAD 3413) when a plan of the cellars of the building and a cross-section of the rear part of the building and the medieval roof were made (Leech, 1999). The party walls are of stone rubble and may also contain medieval fabric and features. Medieval and early modern timberwork could also remain within the floors of the building. The roof at the rear of the property is a unique survival of a medieval domestic roof in Bristol\r\n[Photographs of the interior of the building, including the medieval roof, are held in the Sites and Monuments Record collection of ground-based photographs, Nos.646-676]"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

James Ireland, a wealthy merchant from Bristol, bought an estate in Brislington which included the sites of Flowers Hill Farm and Eastwood Farm and built Brislington Hall. The house was a three-storey six-bay building (Winstone 1985, pl337). There was a lodge at the entrance to the drive, five acres of gardens and thirteen acres of parkland. Ireland added to his estate by buying land from William Reeve, the owner of Arno's Court. In 1828, the property was owned by the Ireland Trustees and let to a succession of tenants including  Jacob Ricketts who was listed as the occupier in the Brisington Tithe Award of 1846. Upon his death in 1846 his widow moved into The Elms. In 1856, James Clayfield-Ireland moved into Brislington Hall, having sold Hemplow House (Ireland 1870: BRO St.LB/HM/1a & 1b). The Clayfield family lived in the house until 1923 when the estate passed to a distant cousin who sold it. Brislington Hall was acquired by the haulage contractors, Henry Russett & Sons. The house was then briefly operated as \"The Lido Spa Hotel\" but the venture did not pay and the property was demolished in 1933 (Rowe & Williams 1985).\r\nThe site was redeveloped for Gallagher's Warehouse, itself demolished in 1984.

The almshouse appears to have been founded by John Barstaple (died 1411) in the early-fifteenth century during the reign of Henry IV and was confirmed by a grant of Henry V in February 1417 (Manchee 1831, 499-500). It appears to have occupied sites on both sides of Old Market Street from its foundation. The fraternity of the Holy Trinity and St. George ran the almshouse and William Worcestre, writing in 1480, notes that John Barstable had appointed Nicholas Barstable as \"master of the priests of the chapel of the Holy Trinity\" (Neale 2000, 82-83).\r\nThe original form of the almshouse is uncertain and the main evidence comes from watercolour drawings (BRSMG M2764, BRSMG M2772 and M2773) dating to 1822 and 1825 in the Braikenridge Collection, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. The buildings appear to have been arranged around a courtyard. The accommodation buildings were of two-storeys with traceried windows of late-medieval date. At first-floor there was gallery or corridor which projected from the main range and was supported on corbels. The entrance doors seem to have been set within ashlar mouldings with four-centred arched heads.\r\nThe chapel is reported to have been rebuilt in 1716, the work being funded by the Bristol Corporation at a cost of £463 4s. 3d (Manchee 1831, 80). It was apparently reworked again in the early 1790s in a Gothick style (Leighton 1933) and some of the rooms in the almshouse were rebuilt in 1814 at an expense of £140 (Manchee 1831, 79).\r\nThe entire almshouse was rebuilt between the mid-1850s and the early 1880s to designs in a Tudor Revival style by Foster and Wood (who also designed the rebuilt Foster's Almshouses in Colston Street ). All of the almshouse buildings are in squared Pennant sandstone rubble with ashlar detailing. The north-east block dates to 1857-1858, while the chapel and the north-west and south-west blocks were reconstructed in 1867. The south-east block dates to 1881-1883. These later blocks show a Burgundian Gothic influence.\r\nThe chapel is a single-storey building. The main entrance to the chapel is off Jacob Street, and consists of a doorway with an ogee hood in the centre of the elevation. The three-light east window has Perpendicular tracery and an ogee hood, with crocketed niches on either side and also above it. The Old Market Street elevation has a three-window range, with two-light arched windows. The roof is gabled on the eastern side and hipped on the western, with small square bell tower on the northern side of the ridge.\r\nThe building has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/12/1633)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Two tenements stood on the site by 1583, one being used as the Custom House at that date (Leech 1997, 169). A new building was constructed on the site of these in 1666 and acted as the Custom House through the later seveneteenth century, although it is not clear whether the structure was purpose-built as a Custom House. This was a square three-bay building of four storeys and attic with a hipped pantile roof. At the time of its construction the building had a cellar measuring 23 1/2 feet wide and extending 32 feet west from Welsh Back. The main, east-facing, elevation fronted on to Welsh Back. By 1825 (BRSMG M2238; BUAD 1360) the ground floor was a shopfront with entrance doorways at the north end and centre. The northern doorway served a narrow property which was in the occupation of Timothy McDonell in 1850 (BRO Corporation Plan Book C fo.98a). The middle doorway led into a passage to the \"Three Cups\" public house, built in 1820 at the rear of the building. On either side of this middle doorway were large shop windows with stall risers beneath. The first-floor fenestration consisted of three large sash windows while at second floor there was a large pedimented coat of arms in the place of the central window. On either side there were smaller cross-windows and the fenestration at third-floor consisted of three cross-windows. At the centre of the east face of the roof there was a small dormer with a cross window. A brick \"turret\" on the rear, west side, of the roof my have given access to a flat roof in the centre. On the north side of building there are a number of tall chimney stacks and towards the centre of the elevation at third-storey level, apparently built into one of the flues, is a feature which may have been a window. A nest of stairs was attached to the north side, some serving an adjacent building. There was also a chimney stack on the south wall. Much of the rear, west-facing, wall had been built against by the early nineteenth century but the elevation had at least two mullion and transom windows, and a three-storey square block with a pyramidal pantile roof had by then been added to its north end. This had single windows at each floor in its west-facing elevation.\r\nIn 1666 the building appears to have been owned by John Goninge and his mother Elizabeth who leased it to John Bowen and Richard Thrupp. A new Custom House was built in Queen Square in 1710, and the cellar beneath the building subsequently passed into the ownership of the Corporation which leased it to Francis Brown in 1719 and to Thomas Lewis in 1786 (Leech 1997, 169).\r\nThe structure seems to have survived into the mid-nineteenth century.

The church had thirteen-bays with buttressed aisles on the north and south sides and was constructed of coursed Pennant sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings. Buttresses projected from either side of the west front, which contained a large tracery window. The east window was also of tracery and contained stained glass by John Hardman & Co. of Birmingham. The roof was pitched and there was an elaborate timber fleche containing four bells slightly to the east of the centre of the ridge of the roof, marking the division between the chancel and the nave. The chapel was 100 feet from east to west and 51 feet wide and could accommodate 350 people (BRO P/StR/1/2; Elliott & Pritchard, 2002 150).\r\nInternally there was a reredos of Derbyshire alabaster with a cross in the centre panel and an oak rood screen with carved trefoil-headed tracery.

The ground floor frontage on New Kingsley Road contained a single large window, which appears to be an enlargement of the original opening for the front door. There was one central sash at second floor and in the gable. On the north-east facing ground floor elevation there was a central large casement window and a smaller casement to the east. Above this the wall was blank. The rear elevation was also blank and rendered. However, there was a stack at the centre of the rear gable and the north side of the elevation had a wide projecting block of fabric, probably relating to the connection of the building to the terrace. The southern part of the building has a two-room depth and was of two storeys with a pitched pantiled roof. The New Kingsley Road elevation was rendered and forms a continuous façade with the northern element. The front door for the public house is in the northern part of the building and there was another large window at the centre. There was a single sash at the centre of the first floor. The gable was hidden behind a parapet. Both elements of the public house appeared to be post-medieval in date.\r\nThe building was demolished in the summer of 2004."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

It was commissioned by Joseph Cohen of Jacey Cinemas Ltd. and built by Frank Wilkins at a cost of £451.1s and took just four months to build (Ewins 1984, 19; 28; Anderson 1983, 55). The News Theatre opened on 26th December 1933 as the first specially designed provincial news theatre (Ewins 1984, 19). The building was very modern in design with a black and green alabaster glass frontage with stainles steel bands and a black tower above the main entrance. The Bristol Evening Post reported on 22nd December 1933 that \"This news theatre is unique in the city, notably in the treatment of its main façade, the whole of which is faced with black and green alabaster glass, having stainless steel bands. The tower which rises above the main entrance is faced in black, and the flanking walls are treated with horizontal bands of green and black glass on a black granite base. Further striking features of this elevation are the neon lighting, which has been arranged to harmonise with the architectural design, and the flashing 'world' sign which depicts a rotating sphere with the continents depicted in red neon. The tones of green, silver, and black have been continued in the decorative scheme of the entrance vestibule, which is in every way strinkingly modern. The decoration has been carried out in tints of peach colour, pale green, and silver to the walls and ceilings, with walnut doors, pale green architraves, and black skirting,\" (Ewins 1984, 19-20). There were approximately 400 seats in the cinema and 50 more than the former Queen's Picture House due to the enlargement of the site (Ewins 1984, 19).\r\nThe cinema remained open until 1956 and was demolished in 1959.

The villa was discovered in 1899, during the construction of a new road to the east of \"Lynwood\" (ST 616710) in the garden of which Romano-British pottery had earlier been found. Barker  (1899, 291) states the remains were situated in a field on the northern side of the present Bath Road, about half a mile beyond Arnos Vale Cemetery. The front elevation of the villa was estimated as being fifty yards back from the current position of the main road. Wick Lane was about fifty yards to the east, while to the west was the garden of \"Lynwood\".   \r\nThe site was excavated in advance of development by the Clifton Antiquarian Club and the Bristol Museum Committee, who uncovered a probable villa dating to the late 3rd-century AD (Barker 1900; 1901). The level of the whole site had been covered with a large amount of rubble. Aaccording to Barker, its deposition was \"comparatively recent\" (Barker 1900, 291) and the rubble may therefore have arrived on the site as a result of alterations to the nearby Bath Road. The construction of the new roadway divided the villa into two portions which made it difficult for the excavators to prepare a complete plan.\r\nThe foundations of the villa measured approximately 120 feet [37 metres] from east to west and were 70 feet [21.4 metres] wide, and excavation revealed a group of rectangular chambers of various sizes. Evidence of hypocausts and tessellated pavements was recorded. The villa was a winged corridor type, which was south-facing with at least ten rooms and a small bath area. Branigan (1969, 18) suggests that the building began as a suite of five rooms, possibly with no interconnecting corridor. He then suggests the villa acquired, in the following sequence, its projecting wing rooms and front corridor, a rear corridor and two rooms projecting north, a small bath suite and finally an extended suite of baths. It was destroyed c.370A.D (Russell and Williams 1984, 23).\r\nQuantities of iron and glass slag were recovered, implying that small-scale manufacturing was taking place within the site. Barker lists the finds made during the excavation, and these include coins, pottery, glassware, bronze artefacts and animal remains.

Its location is recorded by Plumley and Ashmead's 1828 plan of Bristol and the well itself was recorded in drawings of 1788 (BL Add MS 15540 f166) by the Swiss artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm (1733-1794) and of 1823 by Samuel Jackson (in the Braikenridge Collection, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery BRSMG M964). By 1788 the spring had been converted to a well. The head was apparently about 1 metre square, lined with stone and in 1788 was protected on three sides by a post and rail fence. On the other side was a series of steps leading down to two basins in which the water collected. These basins were carved into a single stone block and both had overflow channels on the same side. A memorandum on the well by a local resident written in 1850 (SMR 21305) noted of the water collected in the basins that one contained \"the best drinking water on the hill, and the other water beneficial to persons suffering from inflamed, or otherwise diseased eyes\" (Clark 1850, 85).

The site included the subsequent properties of \"The Elms\"which was formerly called \"Upper Oakenhill\", and a second property formerly known as \"Lower Oakenhill\".  The estate remained in the Daniel family until 1775 when it was sold to William Hall.  (Ireland Manuscripts). Rowe (1985, 13) states the house was rebuilt in the eighteenth century.  In 1780 the estate was sold to Nehemiah Bartley, distiller from Bristol, and as one of the nouveau riche merchants may well have been responsible for the rebuilding of the house.

The lantern had a circular sloping roof with a ball finial at its apex. Single-storey blocks with pitched roofs connected the tower to identical two-storey structures to the north and south. The two-storey blocks appear to have had an identical, mirror-image, form. The west-facing elevations had bay windows at the centre  and a smaller sash window above. There was a moulded stone hood mould over each. The side, outward-facing, elevations had wide projecting three-flue chimney stacks at either end. These projected above the eaves and had three tall individual brick flues with clay chimneypots on top of each stack. Between the stacks, apparently mid-way between ground and first floor level there were small casement windows with a hood mould, possibly indicating the position of internal stairs. The roofs were pitched and there were low parapets at either end. The inward-facing elevations had a large window at ground floor with a hood mould above at its western end. The enclosure was surrounded by a tall curving wall.\r\nThe Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXI.01) published in 1903 records that the lighthouse was had an occulting white light (giving out longer phases of darkness than illumination) with a red sector (a vertical red strip of light in the centre of the beam which was only visible within a certain arc and could therefore be used to set a course). The lighthouse survived into the early nineteenth century but was demolished between mid-1902 and 1908 to allow the construction of Royal Edward Dock. The site is now at the edge of the channel leading from Avonmouth Dock to Royal Edward Dock. All traces of the lighthouse tower will have been removed by the construction of a small dock c.1916 but the at least part of the buildings to either side may well survive."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

At that date it comprised 201 acres (BRO BRO AC/M11/32). By the time of the Whitchurch tithe survey of the earlier nineteenth century the farm was owned by Edward Gore Langton and let to Benjamin Hall (Burchill 1997). The Hall family apparently continued to work the farm until the end of the Second World War, buying the freehold in 1924 (Bantock et al 1996, 32; 117).\r\nThe farmhouse was of probable seventeenth century date. It was of two-storeys and attics and measured approximately 14.5 metres from north-west to south-east by 12.5 metres wide. It was constructed of coursed stone rubble  The south-east and north-west facing elevations were gabled and there were freestone copings on each of the gable ends with a ball finial at the apexes of the gables at the south-western end of the building.

The northern range had a smaller stack apparently at the centre of the ridge and a single flue chimneystack at the south-eastern end of the north-east facing elevation.\r\nBy the early twentieth century the original windows of the south-east and south-west facing elevations had been replaced with timber casement windows. A one-and-a-half storey extension was added to the north-west facing elevation of the farmhouse and a linked building was attached to its south-east corner. A coursed stone rubble wall enclosed the area on the western side of this building and the southern side of the farmhouse, presumably forming a garden.

The farm is recorded by the 1772 Southwell estate plan (BRO 26570) where it is named as Watson Farm, but the date of its creation is unknown. The farm lies somewhat askew to Lawrence Weston Road, suggesting that it may predate the laying out of this road. Desk-based assessment suggested that the farm name derives from the adjacent common meadows of Madam or Mead Hamm (Lawler, 1995 6) underwent many structural changes during its lifetime but nonetheless represented a rare survival of what would probably have been a typical farmhouse in the area.\r\nThe building consisted of two long ranges in a double-pile plan with a further range at right angles towards the rear (North) end of the property. An external inspection of the building showed that the western long range of the building was a later addition. It has a flatter roof pitch and its roof abutted that of the range at the rear. It was, however, probably no later than the late eighteenth century. The rear range was constructed of lias limestone, in marked contrast to the western long range and most of the eastern long range. It would appear, therefore, to have been of a separate build from the rest of the property, although it is uncertain whether it was earlier or later in date than the eastern long range. The eastern long range had been partially rendered, but there were traces of similar lias limestone in the upper courses of the east wall near the eaves, perhaps suggesting that the roof had been replaced at some time in the past. At the northern end of the property was a single storey range which necessitated the bricking up of the original fireplace in the north wall of the earlier building. The bricks used were handmade and probably no later than the mid nineteenth century, suggesting that the extension was built some time in the first half of the nineteenth century.\r\nInternal inspection revealed a long through passage extending the full width of the building through both of the long ranges. In the room to the north of the passage in the eastern long range, there was a plain chamfered ceiling beam with a plain stop and a small cupboard in the east wall with H hinges. There was a similar plain chamfered beam in the room opposite, to the south of the through passage. A door leading to the rear range from the through passage had strap hinges with spearhead ends, while a door on the upper floor had strap hinges with expanded ends. The internal fittings are likely to be original to the building and would suggest an initial date for construction in the late seventeenth or possibly the early eighteenth. The building displayed a conservatism of style which might be expected in an isolated area such as the North Avon Levels.\r\nMadam Farm was inspected by the City Archaeologist for Bristol City Council, Bob Jones on 10th May 1997.

This has been disputed by Evans (2000) who suggests that the house was in fact constructed by a Bristol mason, Philip West, in late 1767 or 1768.\r\nThe buildings were of three-storeys. Photographs in Bristol Reference Library of the Redland Hill (north-west facing) elevation of the southern of the two buildings (B21205) and the entire south-west facing elevation (B21205) records that the structure was rendered with a three-sided bay at the south end. Immediately to the north of this was a projecting entrance porch of classical design. Above the central doorway was a segmental arch supported by pilasters with windows between them. In the parapet above the arch there was a pediment.. A string course dividing the ground from the first floor extended around the whole building. All of the windows were 3 by 4 pane sashes, those in the second floor being slightly smaller. The window openings on the north-east facing elevation were surrounded by mouldings while those in the rear, south-west facing elevation were had ashlar rustication. A tall parapet surrounded, and obscured the roof but there was a large chimney stack at its centre.\r\nThe buildings were extant at the time of the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXI.12.17), surveyed in 1881. The southern of the houses was demolished in 1933 while the northern is extant, having been purchased by Bristol City Council in 1964 to provide accommodation for Redland College. The building subsequently became part of Bristol Polytechnic. It appears from the Ordnance Survey Landline plan of 2000 that part of the rear wall of the southern building may survive on the site, having perhaps been reused as a retaining wall.\r\nThe surviving half of the building has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/34/1725)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The original design for the grounds is recorded in two plans, one of c1806 (Huntington Library, Stowe Papers Box 10, item 4) and another of 1843 (SRO Q/RLU/c/42/8). The design included a model farm and kitchen gardens (Harding & Lambert 1994, 103-104) while the area adjacent to the house, on its east side, was laid out as six airing courts. There were also separate houses in the grounds for wealthier patients where, according to an advertisement of 1809, they were \"allowed to pursue any style of living and expense as to carriages, horses etc. most suitable to their former habits and not inconsistent with their present situation\" (SRO T/PH/Fx 2). These buildings were relatively substantial and included Swiss Cottage, recorded by T. L. Rowbotham in 1827 (Stoddard 1981, 50-51). The house was originally of two storeys with drip moulds over the windows and a pitched roof with elaborate cusped bargeboards and large chimneystacks.

Lancaster was a member of the Society of Friends who sought to create a network of schools for the children of what he called the \"industrious classes\" (Lancaster 1803). Lancaster's system employed monitors, a select group of older pupils who were taught by the master, who, in turn, taught the remaining children. In 1814 the Society was renamed the British and Foreign School Society (BFSS) and the school had become known as the British School by the 1840s. The school initially accepted only boys but a girls school was established in 1813. At 31 December 1841 there were 170 boys and 105 girls on the school roll (Anon 1841).\r\nThe building was built as a three-storey structure of Pennant sandstone rubble bonded in a lime mortar and with a pitched roof. The phasing of construction has not been established but minor alterations including a new playground, had been made by 1846 and in 1850 William Armstrong, an architect based in Brunswick Square, designed a new classroom extension with raked seating at the southern end.\r\nThe school was closed in 1889 because it did not meet the Board School standards and was converted to industrial use.

Subsequently another three rented houses in Wilson Street were acquired, caring for a total of 130 children. Rented houses were not a long-term solution and by 1845 the number of children had risen even further without additional accommodation. Müller decided on the building of a purpose built home to accommodate 300 children. In 1845 he entered into a contract for the purchase of the 7 acres of ground at £120 per acre. The funding for purchase of the site and construction of the buildings came entirely from donations, including a gift from the Bristol sugar refiner Conrad Finzel. On June 18 1849 300 orphans transferred to the new site.\r\nThe plan of the orphanage developed without an overall design. The earliest building is Allen House (listed Grade II: Listed Building number 901-1/32/10038) which was constructed in 1847-49 to a design by the architects John Foster & Son.

The site extended backwards from the street to the river.  The plot of land was laid by the Corporation, who had bought the land in 1656.  The site of the inn was originally a house in the Castle.  Latimer quotes the resolution of the Council:  \"Whereas the Castle is demolished, and a common street and highway made therein. And whereas there was formally a house in the Castle called the George inn.  A new house having been built on part of the old site, and it being very commodious for entertaining men and horses, Ordered that the said house be used as a common inn and hostelry.\"  The Merchant Venturers became the owners of The George in 1686.  At this time there were three tenants:  Walter Lucas, innholder; Edward Hutton, distiller and William Davis, tobacconist.\r\n\r\nGeorge Woolham was the tenant from 1716.  John Whittock was the occupant from 1722 to 1731.  John Dibble and his widow, followed by John Russell and his widow, and then Nathaniel Ridley were successive tenants from 1731 to 1743. Charles Atkinson occuped the premises from 1731 until at least 1749.  John Wolf was the occupant in 1753 and was succeeded by his widow.  S. Wolf is recorded as the tenant in 1775, followed by George Cooper a few years later.  Richard Cox was occupant to Mary Hilsonte, proprietor, in early 1800.  In 1806, the premises were occupied by Davis and Company.  Ball Davis and Co were the occupiers in 1810.\r\n\r\nBy 1820, Richard and Charles Vaughen were the proprietors/occupants, with the premises described as a Wool Warehouse.  The Coalbrookdale Company used the buildings as an iron warehouse from 1829, the premises being described as \"shop and warehouse\" in the 1850's and 1860's.  The 1883 OS survey at 1:500 scale showed most of the site as a warehouse but with only half of the 24m street frontage.  The remainder was occupied by two smaller premises (nos. 83 & 84).  Later OS plans (1:2500 scale) show the building with a long covered haulingway running virtually the length of site.  By this time Lindrea and Company, leather makers and importers were at this address, remaining here until the construction of the Regent Cinema in the later 1920's."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The products of the pottery have received attention since the existence of the pottery was brought to a wider audience by Hugh Owen (1873), and its history has since been addressed by others, notably W. J. Pountney (1920) and Oliver Kent (1996).\r\nThe pottery was founded by John Bissicke, who had connections to the Southwark potteries, and Ralph Bennett in the 1650s. By the 1680s Edward Ward had taken over the pottery.

The first phase, the founding and operation of the pottery by Bissicke and Bennett when pieces bearing simple geometric or brush decoration were produced, was followed by a second from 1679. Pieces bearing the simple geometric designs continued to be produced but there was a shift to figurative and political designs. The third phase began in the late 1740s, after the pottery had been sold, when with new investment in technology it began to produce red wares (Kent 1996, 80-81)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Fox purchased part of the then recently enclosed Brislington Common for £4000 and built Brislington House in 1804 as a private hospital for the treatment of the insane (Pevsner 1958, 465). The building has been noted as an early example of the use of cast iron structural elements for fire protection (Richardson 1998, 156-157) and was composed of a series of linked houses where patients were accommodated according to their social rank and means. There was also care to segregate the sexes, each in \"a distinct house, detached from the others by a considerable interval\" (Fox & Fox 1836, 4). This segregation resulted in two identical wings being built with the dividing wall running through the central part of the main building, the baths and the airing ground. The door on the main façade was the only entrance to the asylum where a porter was constantly on duty. These six houses were joined together and remodelled in the Italian Renaissance style with a nine-bay centre and a lower nine-bay wing on each side (Pevsner 1959, 465; Stoddard 1981, 50-51). The chapel, reportedly the first in an asylum, was added in 1851, and a ballroom and concert room were built in 1866. There were also separate houses in the grounds (SMR 1229) for wealthier patients where according to an advertisement of 1809 they were \"allowed to pursue any style of living and expense as to carriages, horses etc. most suitable to their former habits and not inconsistent with their present situation\" (SRO T/PH/Fx 2).\r\nDr. Fox retired in 1829 and went to live at Heath House. He died in 1835 and was buried in burial ground of the Society of Friends on the south side of Bath Road (SMR 10187). After his death the management of the asylum was taken over by two of his sons, Dr. Francis Ker Fox and Dr. Charles Henry Fox. Succeeding generations of the Fox family managed the asylum with Dr. Francis Elliot Fox being the last postholder until his death in 1947. The patients were then moved to other institutions. The house was purchased by the former Bristol United Hospital Authority for £40,000 and was used as a Nurses' Home until 1983 when it was sold, to be re-opened as a private nursing home in November 1984.\r\nThe grounds appear to have been re-landscaped after 1846 (BRO EP/A/32/9) and the arrangment of the new planting is recorded by the Ordnance Survey 1:2500 plan of 1884.\r\nThe building received a Grade II listing in March 1984 (Listed Building number 901-1/49/440)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The date at which the building was construction is unknown but its form at the end of the nineteenth century suggests that it may have been constructed in the seventeenth century. The building was extant by the time of the survey of Bristol by John Plumley and George Ashmead of 1828. In 1871 the building was occupied by E. Smale, stationer, and a photograph of roughly that date (Winstone 1966, pl.77) indicates that the building was probably refronted in the early nineteenth century. The building was then a rendered three-storey house with a pitched pantile roof. The main, north-west facing, elevation was of three bays. At ground-floor level the centre bay contained the main entrance doorway and this had a single stone step up from the footway of East Street with a footscraper on its western side. There were bay windows on either side of the entrance, and the eastern of these was square while the western was canted. The western bay window contained a central 4 by 4 pane sash and 2 by 4 pane sashes in the side. The ground floor was divided from the first floor by a flat canopy which rested on the top of the bay windows and extended across the full width of the elevation, also sheltering the main entrance. The fenestration at first-floor level consisted of single 3 by 4 pane sash windows in each of the three bays. The three second-floor windows, again with in each bay, were smaller and appear to be casements. Above the tops of these windows, at the west end of the elevation, there was a gout (serving a gutter behind the parapet) which emptied into a downpipe.

The Bedminster tithe survey of 1841 indicated that the farm consisted of a farmhouse, yard and garden with outbuildings. The tithe map indicates that the farmhouse was a long building aligned north-east to south-west positioned at the centre of the farm site with outbuildings to either side. Some 5 metres to the east of the farmhouse was a pound (SMR 21199), which was also in existence by the late eighteenth century. The farm was then owned, along with much other land in the immediate area, by William Gore-Langton and was rented by John Smith and Elizabeth Sellett.. The Ordnance Survey first edition 1:2500 plan (Somerset Sheet VI.14) published in 1885 names the farm as Brook Farm and indicates that while most of the buildings recorded by the tithe map were still extant, an extension at the south-east corner of the farmhouse had been demolished. The plan also records a well just to the south of the farmhouse (at ST 57391 68587). Several of the farm outbuildings survived into the 1950s but most were demolished in the 1960s when a garage was constructed to the north-west of the farmhouse.\r\nThe farmhouse itself is extant and is now a two-storey rectangular building, measuring 9.5 metres from north-east to south-west by 8 metres wide, with a single-storey extension on the eastern side. The building is constructed of coursed stone rubble. The main, south-west facing elevation is of three bays with a main entrance door at the centre of the elevation. All of the openings have plain ashlar mouldings. Originally there were chimneystacks at the eastern and western ends of the building. These were apparently extant in the 1970s (Bantock, 1996) but have subsequently been removed. The pantile roof is hipped.

An existing post-medieval house standng on the site was demolished and a new house was constructed (although some of the panelling was apparently reused in the new house) between 1732 and 1735 to designs by John Strahan for John Cossins, a retired London grocer (Ison 1952, 164). The house is a two-storey ashlar building with a hipped roof and cellar. In plan the building had an entrance hall on the north side with stairwells on either side. The eastern stairwell contains a winder stair while the western has a spiral stair. The hall led into the dining room and this connected on its west side with a parlour and on the east with another dining room (Ison 1952, 164-170). All of the rooms have a marble chimneypiece on the west wall and are panelled. The house appears to have had extensive landscaped grounds to the south-east, including a tree avenue approximately 600 metres long (SMR 21899) running north-west from a rusticated stone arch (SMR 21902) with crenellations at modern Cotham Grove towards the house. The newly-completed house and its grounds were surveyed in 1732, the plan surviving in the plans of the British Library. The arch was drawn by James Stewart in 1746 and was still extant in 1828. In 1747 Thomas Paty was commissioned design two pavilions, linked to the north-east and north-west corners of the house by corridors (Charlton & Milton 1951, 61-62).\r\nJohn Cossins died in 1759 and bequeathed the Redland Court estate to his wife Martha (neé Innys). The couple had no children and at her death Martha left the estate to her brother Jeremy Innys who had been living at Redland Court since 1755. At his death in 1765 it passed to another of the Innys siblings, John Innys, and when he died in 1778 to Jeremy Baker (Martha Cossin's nephew). Baker died in 1798 and the estate was auctioned to pay his debts. Much of the land appears to have been bought by Sir John Smyth who subsequently leased it to Stephen Cave, while Henry Seymour purchased the house for £9200. Seymour's son Henry sold the house to Sir Richard Vaughan in 1811. Vaughan was declared bankrupt in December 1828 and the house was purchased in the following December by James Evan Baillie who initially lived there and continued to own it until his death in 1863. George Oldham bought Redland Court in 1864 and on his death in 1883 the house was acquired by Redland High School for Girls. The school moved into the buildings in 1885 (Little 1983, 4). The associated landscape park was developed for housing in the later-nineteenth century. The school commissioned the architectural practice Oatley and Lawrence to convert the stables to classrooms and refront the building in 1911-1912 (Little 1983, 7).\r\nThere has been little archaeological work at Redland Court but the stairs of the building were surveyed by C.

The house measured roughly 8.5 metres long by 6 metres wide and had a single-pile plan. On the northern side of the house there was a large projecting element containing the rear part of the main stair. The original internal plan comprised an entrance hall leading to a centrally-placed main stair with a drawing room on either side of the hall. The stair rose to a landing and appears to have divided into two half-turn stairs, one on either side, to serve first-floor landings (Brett et al. 1994).\r\nThe building was sited on a small promontory and appears to have stood within a large, south-facing garden plot.

The earliest reference to the monument is probably by the antiquarian Samuel Seyer (1821, 102). The monument was partially excavated, in December 1873, by Montgomery (SMR 20757) who excavated a section four feet (1.2 metres) wide \"from the south side to the centre\" (Anon. 1875). An archaeological evaluation trench was excavated on the east side of the monument by the University of Bristol Spelaeological Society in 1922 or 1923 (Tratman 1946, 169-171). Grinsell visited the monument on 9 May 1952 measuring it as 20 paces across and standing 7 feet [just over 2 metres] high (O'Neil & Grinsell 1960, 100).\r\nThe lack of a formal report either by Montgomery or by Tratman (the archive for the latter work reportedly having been destroyed by bombing during the Second World War) means that detailed interpretation of the monument is currently difficult. However, it appears to have consisted of a central earth mound, possibly of turf, with a surrounding outer ring of stone. Montgomery recovered human remains, including fragments of a skull, thereby confirming the funerary nature of the monument. No firm dating evidence has yet been recovered, although worked flint was recovered by both Montgomery and Tratman. Tratman suggested a Middle Bronze Age date for the monument by analogy with a similar barrow excavated in Glamorgan (Tratman 1946, 170-171). It has been suggested, apparently on the basis of the name of the field within which the monument lies - \"Mill Tut field\" - that the barrow was later reused as the mound for a windmill.\r\nThe monument is suffering some wear, with an erosion track probably formed by children's bicycles running from east to west across the top of the monument. The barrow is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (SAM No. AV 27)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

By 1869 the building was a public house, the New Dock Gates Tavern, run by Mary Ann Wyatt. By 1874 street directories indicate that the ownership had changed and it was then run by Robert Jones. Mary Jones, presumably the wife of Robert Jones, had taken over as licensee by 1879 and she appears to have changed the name of the public house to the New Dock Gates Inn by 1884. Use of the building as a public house continued well into the twentieth century.\r\nThe building is a house of two storeys and attic with a pitched pantile roof. The building is constructed of Brandon Hill Grit in a random rubble construction bonded in a white lime mortar and is currently rendered with a sand-cement render. The original plan of the building is not clear but it may have been of two rooms at each floor off a central hall. The main, north-facing, elevation is of three bays with a central entrance at ground floor and single large sash windows on either side. The cellar has chimneybreasts at the eastern and western ends, with steps leading down, presumably from a cellar opening on to Dock Gate Lane, at the south-west corner. An extension had been added to the rear of the building by the time of the Ordnance Survey first edition 1:500 plan (Bristol Sheet LXXV.4.7) surveyed in 1883. Evidence within the building (BUAD 3851) also suggests that the main elevation was reconstructed in brick at first floor level during the nineteenth century and that the gables at either end of the building were also replaced. The pitch of the roof was probably also increased at this time.\r\nBy the late twentieth century the building was in use as an office and the interior walls were removed at ground floor to create an open plan office, probably in the 1980s.

The site was a heavy anti-aircraft battery located on the crest of the south-west to north-east ridge of Purdown.

In June 1940, it was converted into a permanent four-gun position with two more positions being added later in the war. During the Second World War Bristol was defended by about twenty anti-aircraft batteries. Purdown was one of eight which were fixed.\r\nThe battery consisted originally of four octagonal gun positions on the south-western side of the battery, each with three ammunition bays. At the centre of the position was a complex containing the command post and associated buildings, while the two magazines were sited on the north-west side of the site. Dobinson indicates that the battery armament of four 3.7in static guns remained the same between the summer of 1941 and January 1943 and that the battery did not have radar (Dobinson 1996, 330). Two additional square gun positions built of reinforced concrete blocks were added later (Roberts 1981). Early in the war the battery was also equipped with Lewis gun emplacements. An attack on the 2 December 1940 resulted in a high explosive bomb wounding of the crew of one of these emplacements, one member later dying of wounds (Penny 1997, 15-16).

One large (cap?) stone leans against a stone set in the ground and on the north side there is another lying nearly flat. No evidence of any surrounding mound or cairn now survives above ground.\r\nThe monument was identified by Rev.

The 1983 evaluation, however, found a spread of limestone rubble around the stones which was thought to be the remains of the original mound. A human to bone was also found to the south of the stones and this produced a calibrated radiocarbon date of 2889 to 2460 BC at a 95% confidence. Analysis of a buried soil beneath the rubble produced molluscan evidence to suggest that the monument had been constructed in a woodland environment. It appears from finds evidence at one side of the monument that the mound which had surrounded the stones was likely to have been removed by Roman-British and later ploughing.

A minster is thought to have stood on the site by the early eighth century. In c963AD a Benedictine monastery was established at the site by Oswald (Bishop of Worcester, 961-992). He appointed a monk named Germanus from the abbey of Fleury at Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire (where Oswald had spent a period earlier in his career) as prior and Westbury became a focus of a Benedictine revival in the region (Graham 1907, 107). In 968-970 the monastery was suppressed and the monks transferred to the Ramsey abbey in northern Cambridgeshire. The monastery was refounded by Bishop Wulfstan (1062-1096) as a cell of Worcester in about 1086. In 1093 it was endowed with lands in Westbury itself, Henbury, Charlton and elsewhere in Gloucesterhshire. The monastery was again suppressed, this time by Bishop Samson (1096-1113) and a college of secular canons was established. In 1286 this was enlarged from five to fourteen canonries by Bishop Giffard (1286-1301) in an attempt to have the churches within his patronage made prebendal to Westbury (Hoskin 2003, 439). Westbury College was reconstituted by Bishop Carpenter (1443-1476) with a grammar school and almshouse. The grammar school was founded in 1463 and the master was funded through the revenues of the Clifton parish church, St. Andrew. The first master was Roger Fabell and along with all of the subsequent masters he held the post together with another benefice. Carpenter also funded exhibitions for six scholars at Oriel College, Oxford and the dean of had the right to nominate at least one exhibitioner (Orme 1976, 182-184). Edward IV granted a number of manors and other privileges to Westbury in the 1460s (Graham 1907, 108). In 1535 the college comprised the Dean, the Sub-Dean, five prebendaries, Bishop Carpenter's chaplain, eight fellows, four clerks, six aged priests, twelve choristers and a schoolmaster (Graham 1907, 108).\r\nThe College was surrendered to the Crown in February 1544, the surrender document being signed by the Dean, John Barlo[w], the Sub-Dean John Lawrence and John Kerell and Thomas Barlo[w], prebendaries (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 65). This also resulted in the loss of the grammar school. The College site and its property holdings were purchased by Sir Ralph Sadleir in March 1544 (Gairdner & Brodie 1903, 175-176).\r\nDuring the Royalist attack on Bristol in July 1643 Prince Rupert was quartered at the College (Firth 1925, 183) and it was apparently one of the buildings fired by Royalist troops as the New Model Army arrived to attack Bristol in 1645. The College building was drawn by James Stewart in September 1747.\r\nArchaeological excavation in 1968 directed by M. W. Ponsford of Bristol City Museum, revealed a boundary wall and stone jetty adjoining the River Trym, interpreted as a possible part of the college of 1194. Also recorded were buildings dating from the thirteenth- to the fifteenth-centuries with an L-shaped moat around the site.

The main entrance is at the centre of this elevation. The plans submitted to the Sanitary Athority in 1899 (BRO Building Plan Book 37 fo.10) suggest that the rear wall was blind. \r\nThe works was expanded by the addition of a box store to the north end of the main building in 1900, other extensions in 1906 and 1907 and installation of a single-storey \"Suction Gas Plant\" in 1910 (BRO Building Plan Book 53 fo.4). A further extension was added to the west in 1913 and an office was constructed on the south part in 1915 (BRO Building Plan Book 63 fo.24). The architectural style of the Lodge Road elevations of these extension was matched to that of the original building, although the office element at the southern end of the building has a hipped pantile roof.\r\nThere were no further alterations until 1961 when a two-storey brick extension and ancillary structures were added to the west of the site. This work may have included alterations to the interior of the 1899 building.\r\nThe factory is extant, including the roof trusses and cast iron columns of the original building. It is not clear, however, what evidence for the production process survives internally. Inference from the date of construction of the factory suggests that the organisation of work, and hence the form of the building, may have been influenced by the concept of the production line but there is at present (26/04/2001) no evidence to support this. Similarly, the potential for archaeological evidence for process within the large extension constructed in the 1960s is unknown."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

In the eighteenth century the narrow highway of the medieval bridge was causing an impediment to the flow of the increasing volume of vehicular traffic through the city. In October 1758, as a reponse to public concern, the Corporation formed a committee to consider the options for improvements. Public disagreement over the various schemes prevented any final decision being reached. It was however resolved to construct a temporary wooden bridge alongside the medieval bridge which opened in early 1762 (Ison 1952, 115-117). In 1760 an Act of Parliament was obtained to allow works to be undertaken (Marcy 1968, 152).\r\nThe design ultimately used was produced by James Bridges. The bridge was built under the supervision of Thomas Paty between 1764 (the foundation stone being laid on 9 April) and 1768, reusing at least some of the piers of the medieval bridge (Barrett 1789, 77). The classical design is in limestone ashlar, the stone used being Courtfield stone from Monmouthshire (Ison 1952, 122) and comprises a central segmental arch flanked by two semi-circular arches, with rusticated voussoirs, soffits and pilaster strips. There were Portland stone balustrades, divided into three bays above each arch, with semi-circular iron lamp brackets above the apex of the central span. At either end of the bridge a pair of square, domed toll houses were built. The tolls imposed to cross the bridge were unpopular and ultimately provoked a serious riot in 1793 (Jones 1980; Manson 1997). When the practice of charging tolls was ended the four toll houses were converted to use as small shops.\r\nThe bridge was widened in 1873-74 by the addition of a cast-iron deck supported by paired cast-iron Doric columns on either side of the bridge. The toll houses were removed as part of this work. Steel pavement extensions and handrails were added in the 1930s.\r\nCurrently (01/02/2000) there is some damage to the ashlar, particularly the voussoirs and the Victorian elements of the bridge are badly corroded and unstable.\r\nAn archaeological analysis of the bridge was undertaken in early 2000 by Roger Leech. This identified the survival of ashlar foundations of three of the four eighteenth-century toll houses, as well as foundations of two shops and a blocked arch interpreted as the outlet for the necessary house associated with those shops (Leech 2000).\r\nThe bridge was a Scheduled Ancient Monument (SAM Number AV 158) but was descheduled in 2004.

Rowbotham and other artists which he commissioned (see Stoddard 1981, 27-41).\r\nThe main part of the house was of three storeys with bay windows on either side of the entrance. Both bay windows had three, three-by-four pane sashes at ground and first floor levels and three-by-two pane sashes at second floor. The main door was at the centre of the elevation and was protected by a projecting canopy apparently supported on cast iron columns. At first floor there was a tripartite window with a central three by four pane sash and one by four pane windows on either side. Above this and spanning the full width of the window was a lunette. At second floor level there was another tripartite window with a central three by one pane window and single panes on either side. Above the fenestration a projecting, moulded cornice terminated abruptly on the south-facing elevation of the building. The roof was hipped and there were stacks at the north and south ends and another slightly to the north of the centre of the roof. On the both the north and south sides of the building there were a single-storey extension with pitched roofs. The northern was elaborately decorated by Braikenridge soon after he moved in. He inserted a gothic window with a drip-mould above in the centre of the west facing elevation, a crenellated parapet and a crocketed spirelet at its north end. At the centre of the west facing elevation was a coat of arms, although this had been removed by 1872 (Jones & Chown, 1977 pl.70: SMR 20597). On the apex of the parapet at the north end of the extension was a stone cross supported on a small arch. The decoration of the southern extension is unknown.\r\nBraikenridge was still in residence at the time of the Brislington Tithe Award of 1846 (BRO EP/A/32/9). His son, Reverend George Weare Braikenridge, however put the house on the market in 1867. A sale prospectus describes the house as having ten bedrooms, extensive wine and beer cellars, warm air apparatus and a large courtyard with five-stall stable, coach house, brewhouse, and sheds for livestock (Ireland, 1870: Bristol Record Office: St. LB/HM/1a & 1b). It was bought in 1868 by William Procter Baker, a wealthy corn merchant and Alderman of Bristol. Between 1896 and 1915 George Johnson occupied the property.\r\nThe Brislington Tithe Map indicates that the house was reached by a long drive lined with trees, with its entrance being directly opposite the entrance to Wick House. By 1872 a path ran in front of the west-facing elevation (Jones & Chown 1977, pl.70).\r\nThe house was demolished in 1928 to make way for the development of new housing. Monitoring of subsequent redevelopment of the site in 2004 (SMR 21806) recorded the footprint of the building and the surviving basement which was infilled and left in situ beneath the front gardens of the new buildings."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

By 1661 the spring, described as \"a certen Well of Water called the Hottwell\", was owned by Joseph Whittington and William Hodges and that year they granted it to the Bristol Corporation on a one thousand year lease (Taylor 1884). The site seems to have consisted of a well (Exwood & Lehman 1993, 104-105) until 1695 when a pump-room was built and the place became a favourite resort (Hembry 1990). By the mid-eighteenth century a number of buildings had been constructed around the pump-room, including lodging houses and Angerstein reports that in 1754 visitors paid a subscription of 5 shillings to use the pump-room itself (Berg & Berg 2001, 132). The spa drew many visitors to the city, and allowed a number of other ventures to develop, notably providing audiences for the Playhouse at Jacobs Wells Road.

The development of Clifton in the eighteenth century had increased the population of the parish to such an extent that the parish church could not accommodate all of the worshippers. It was also anticipated that the capacity of the existing churchyard would also be reached relatively quickly. An Act of Parliament to enable the rebuilding of the existing church (SMR 20285) and the acquisition of land to extend the churchyard was obtained in March 1816 (56 Geo.III Cap.vii). At that date the Rector of the parish was the Rev. James Vaughan of Wraxall and the vicar was the Rev. Stonhouse-Vigor.\r\nThe replacement church was constructed between 1819-1822 to a design by James Foster. It was an ashlar structure with a three-stage tower at the western end (Pevsner 1958, 446). The organ was built by John Smith senior of the Bristol organ builders John Smith and Sons and was completed by November 1822.\r\nThe church was gutted by bombing during the Second World War and the remains of the shell were demolished in 1958 (Anon. 1959, 155-156).

The Bristol Corporation took the decision to develop an urban square on the marsh to the south of the city at the end of the seventeenth century. The ground surface was raised by dumping approximately 2.5 metres of material, mainly industrial waste (Insole 1999), and the first house was built by a Dr. Reade who apparently began construction in 1700. The leases issued by the Corporation were very specific about the materials to be used in the housing and in restricting the trades which could be carried on from them (Ison 1952, 142). Building was completed in 1732, the north-west corner of the square being the last to be completed, but the green space at the centre initially had no formal layout. It did however reuse the trees from the earlier ropewalks (which were removed after lobbying by residents in 1710) to provide shaded walks and Millerd's map of c.1715 shows railings set around it.\r\nThe square was intended as an exclusive residence, appropriating to the city's middle class what had formerly been a place of recreation and assembly for all. To form a centrepiece the Corporation commissioned an equestrian statue of William III by Michael Rysbrack (BUAD 308M) which was erected in September 1736. To enhance this formal paths on north-south and east-west axes were created, dividing the square into quadrants which were crossed diagonally by gravel paths. The Mansion House and the Custom House were built on the north side of the square. Illustrations in the Braikenridge Collection, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery suggest that in the early nineteenth century the trees on the square were being actively managed.\r\nIn October 1831 after the failure of the Reform Bill in the House of Lords the Square was the scne of rioting. This was highly destructive to the buildings of the Square. The Mansion House and Custom House were fired by the rioters and the fire spread to the adjoining dwellings, particularly on the north and west sides of the Square, which were gutted. Although the buildings were reconstructed in the following decade, the riots initiated a decline in the social status of the square; houses were divided into multiple tenancies and businesses took some over as premises.\r\nBetween 1937 and 1941 the dual carriageway of the inner circuit road was driven through the square. The Rysbrack statue was rotated from its original position facing north to face north-west, aligned with the road. A number of air raid shelters were constructed in the square in the years immediately before the Second World War. The road was closed in 1990 as a preliminary to a scheme to restore the square. This restoration project, carried out between September 1999 and 5th July 2000 when the square re-opened to the public, included the removal of the road surface, reorientation of the Rysbrack statue to its original position and the insertion of gravel walks.\r\nArchaeological work in the square has focused on the buildings and several were surveyed by Dr Roger Leech and the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England. An archaeological evaluation (BUAD 3369) was carried out in November 1998 in the south-western corner of the square to inform the restoration project and an archaeological watching brief (BUAD 3515) was maintained during the groundworks associated with the project (Etheridge 2000; Williams 1999, 104). There are also several photographs of the square and its buildings in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Wells 1975: Winstone 1957; 1962; 1970; 1971; 1986).\r\nA number of the buildings surrounding the square have listed status, including the Mansion House, the nineteenth-century Custom House and the equestrian statue of King William III by Michael Rysbrack (Grade I)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The original Lion House lay to the north of the centre point along the east-west terrace and measured approximately 40m east-west by 7 metres making it the largest and most prominent animal house in the gardens during the nineteenth century. The building had a rectangular plan with a large central bow bay. Photographs suggest that the building was neo-classical in style and that the bow bay formed a portico on the south elevation with pediment above. The guide book plan of 1886 indicates that the building contained eleven small cages for big cats set against the rear wall with a viewing area in front. The 1899 guide book shows that the internal space had been reconfigured with the number of cages increased to fourteen. An early twentieth century drawing by Samuel Loxton (Bristol Reference Library W1401) shows large cages for big cats in front of the building. These had been added after 1903 and are shown on the Ordnance Survey 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire sheets LXXI.15 and LXXI.16) surveyed in 1913.\r\nThe building was demolished in 1971 and replaced with an Ape House.

The camp was built by the Admiralty in 1779 to hold those captured during the American War of Independence (Vintner 1956). The earliest record of the presence of the building, though not its form, is a plan, titled \"Division 8th\", which dates to c1779-1783 (BRO AC/PL59). The original form of the prison is recorded in an engraving by J. P. Malcolm published in May 1814 (SMR 20996). This indicates that the prison buildings were originally surrounded by high stone outer walls with four pairs of elevated sentry boxes at intervals along each side. These sentry boxes were set on a platform (probably wooden), immediately below the level of the parapet, supported by a narrow column at each corner and each was reached by a stair on its southern side. Those at the ends appear to have been exceptions since the stair runs along the adjoining wall rather than being freestanding, suggesting that the stairs were supported by cross-members set into the prison walls. There was a gate at the centre of the south wall.\r\nThe cell blocks were of three storeys with a pitched roof and were constructed of stone rubble with ashlar detailing. The blocks had an axial, E-shaped plan and a symmetrical front with a three-window central projecting block. Each main elevation had sixteen bays, each containing a plain barred window at first-floor level. There were small brick chimney stacks along the ridge of the roof and also a number of narrow rooflights.\r\nThe prison presumably stood empty until it was leased by the Bristol Guardians of the Poor as a workhouse c1831 and it was probably at this time that the outer walls were demolished. The western of the two prison blocks was demolished between 1861 and 1865 to make way for new workhouse buildings. The eastern block is extant but the interior is reported by the listing to have been remodelled in the twentieth century. It is not clear what other structures associated with the prison remain (Leech 2001).\r\nThe surviving building has a Grade II listing (901-1/30/1274). The listing details note that it is an early and important example. The only other known prison of this period and type is the Norman Cross camp at Yaxley in Cambridgeshire which operated between 1796 and 1816. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument survives mainly as earthworks, although the officer's quarters and part of the boundary wall are extant."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

W. Godwin made his home at the building, and between 1863 and 1865 it also provided the office for his architectural practice (in partnership with Henry Crisp). Godwin developed an interest in interior design and was strongly influenced by Japanese domestic design. He removed many of the Georgian features of the building and implemented his own decorative scheme comprising an austere interior with oriental accessories (Soros 1999, 186). The actress Ellen Terry, who visited Godwin in the building, published a short description of this interior in her memoirs (BUAD 3937; Craig & St. John 1933, 37-38). This appears to have been the first occasion on which Godwin put his views on interior design into practice. By 1896 the building was in use as a boot factory.

A lean-to structure, interpreted as a \"necessary\" or former pantry, against exterior of the north wall built as part of the kitchen contained an oculus doorframe with an oval light above. The smaller structure on the east of the courtyard was interpreted as a possible pentice giving covered access to the stables/warehouse.\r\nIn the mid-eighteenth century, the closet wing at the south-west corner of the house was partly demolished and the line of the wall extended.

The school seems to have been built in the mid-1840s, apparently to a design by the architect Henry Rumley. Rumley's initial scheme of 1847 (BRO 222638(36)) does not appear to have been implemented but a school was probably in existence on the site soon afterwards. As built the school was a single-storey structure of coursed sandstone rubble, with Perpendicular Gothic ashlar details and a pitched roof. There was apparently a lantern at the northern end of the roof and a projecting chimneypiece at the centre of the roof. By January 1861 a new schoolroom had been added to the building (BRO P/St.MS/Sch/2(3)). The internal plan consisted of classrooms for the mixed school on the northern and southern sides of the entrance of Station Road, the southern being a large L-shaped space. There was an infants classroom behind these rooms and two pairs of toilets attached to the exterior of the north and east sides of the building. A new extension, designed by P. J. Byrne, was constructed at the southern end of the building in 1892 (BRO P/St.MS/Sch/2(6)). This matched the scale, style and materials of the original school.

The hospital was founded by Robert de Berkeley (d.1219) \"for a master and several brethren who should tend the sick and infirm and the needy traveller.\" The hospital was not monastic and the wardenship could be held with another benefice. The bretheren wore the same clothing as secular priests with the wheel of St. Katherine on the left breast (Scott Holmes 1914, lvi-lvii).\r\nThere would appear to have been some problem with the administration of the hospital in 1324-1325 when the register of Bishop Drokensford records that a visitand was commissioned to audit the accounts of the, then master, remove him, and appoint a brother from St. John's Hospital at Redcliff Hill as guardian (Hobhouse 1887, 239).\r\nThe form of the hospital is currently uncertain. Currently direct evidence comes mainly from William Worcestre who, in 1480, recorded the nave of the chapel as measuring approximately 16 yards long by 7 1/2 yards wide. The chancel was roughly 9 yards long by 5 1/2 yards wide\" (Neale 2000, 280-281). Worcester also indicates that there was a cross associated with the hospital (Neale 2000, 94-97).\r\nThe churchwardens accounts of All Saints parish for 1525-1526 record 4d. paid \"to the lazar house at Bright Bowe in bread\" (Burgess 2000, 325) but it is not clear whether the hospital had by then essentially become a leper hospital. By 1548 there were no inmates in the hospital (Green 1888). The hospital survived into the middle of the reign of Elizabeth I, the last recorded master, F. Nevil, being appointed in 1573.\r\nBy 1791 the buildings had been converted to dwellings and the only surviving element was the east end of the chapel where there was a blocked Gothic window (Collinson 1791, 282). These features were apparently demolished in 1887 to make way for construction of a new tobacco factory for W. O. & H. D.

In October 1917 a factory, National Filling Factory No.23 (SMR 21403), had been opened at Chittening to manufacture the blister agent mustard gas (sulphur mustard - 1,1-thiobis(2-chloroethane)) in response to German use of the weapon in the early stages of the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele). Work ceased at Chittening in April 1918 and production was moved to the Avonmouth factory which was converted and extended between May and early June 1918, using equipment originally made for Chittening.\r\nInitially the factory used the Guthrie high temperature process and the first batch was produced on 15 June. By the end of June 3.5 tonnes of the gas had been manufactured but this production yield was too low. French scientists were approached for advice and recommended adoption of the Levinstein low temperature method. The reaction temperature was reduced to 40 degrees Centigrade in the first half of July and this resulted in improved yields. However, the ethylene unit required complete overhaul in the second half of the month and this resulted in the shutting down of the entire plant. The first acceptable batch of the chemical was produced on 15 August 1918 (Haber 1986, 165-166; Hartcup 1988, 109) but production levels remained low until September 1918.\r\nThe factory was operational for around six months and had a workforce of 1100. An existing short section of railway was brought into passenger use and the St. Andrew's Road station (SMR 5042) was opened in May 1917 to bring workers to the site. The dangers inherent with the handling of the chemical coupled with the use of porous materials, such as wood and brick, in the construction of the plant led to a high rate of injury amongst the workforce. This was exacerbated by the fact that the factory was still under construction when manufacture began, resulting in \"trying conditions for the workers\" (Anon. 1919, 81). Between 15 June and 15 December 1400 gas casualties were recorded at the Avonmouth factory (Haber 1986, 249) including three fatalities. Around 700 workers were affected, \"some of whom had three or four attacks,\" and the sickness resulting included \"blisters on every part of the body (except the palms of the hands), conjunctivitis, bronchitis, etc., and chronic effects of debility, cough, gastric pain and breathlessness\" (Anon. 1919, 81). The Avonmouth factory ceased production at 8:00pm on 11 November 1918. In all, the factory produced 560 tons of mustard gas, and 416 tons of this were deemed acceptable for shell filling (Haber 1986, 166).\r\nThe layout of the factory is currently uncertain but most of the original factory buildings appear to have been demolished. However, the administration building of the factory is extant. This is a two-storey brick structure with ashlar quoins. The building is orientated north south and has an H-shaped plan. The main element of the building has a central porch with a single doorway with ashlar detailing, including a pediment. It has a hipped roof with tall square projecting brick chimneystacks. There are a number of other surviving structures, including sheds, which may have been associated with the factory. There are also known to have been several reactors and the site was served by an internal electric railway. Three of the battery-powered locomotives were acquired by the Hythe Pier Railway (one being used for spares) where they still operate."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

In June 2002 Michael Fairfax was commissioned by the Bristol City Archaeologist, R. H. Jones, to produce an artwork to mark the site of the Bronze Age round barrow on the northern side of Bowness Gardens. Fairfax designed an obelisk, a pyramid of brushed stainless steel which tapered to a rounded point. The piece was 2.0 metres tall, 0.64 metres wide and 0.25 metres thick. The upper 0.25 metres of the obelisk is mirror-polished and beneath, on the south-east face, there is a circle comprising 23 mirror-polished lines which radiate from an indented central hole 30 millimetres in diameter. A text written by Fairfax laser-cut into the surface runs downwards from the circle and furls into a spiral towards the base. The text reads \"At Badocks wood ghostly windmill sails turn and like a rewound film spin through history to remote times when this was a burial place for a bronze age warrior. In that past landscape wolves prowled and nervy deer grazed while wild hog rooted among trees.\"\r\nThe obelisk was installed on 19 February 2003, the commissioning and installation process costing £8000 in all.

The church was probably founded before 1066, although the exact date is unknown, and it is commonly assumed, on the basis of the placename evidence, to have an origin as a minster church. It may perhaps also have been the centre of a large estate (Costen 1992, 71). The church lay at the northern boundary of the diocese of Salisbury (and later Bath and Wells) and consequently was the mother church to Abbots Leigh and to St. Mary Redcliffe and St. Thomas the Martyr in Redcliffe.\r\nSt. John is reported, along with other buildings in Bedminster, to have been burnt by Prince Rupert's troops as they retreated from Bristol in 1645. In January 1651/2 the parish entered a plea at the Quarter Sessions for assistance in raising the estimated £3500 pounds which repair of the church would cost (SMR 20351; Bates Harbin 1912, 202). The rebuilt church is recorded in watercolours in the Braikenridge Collection, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery and in a watercolour executed by John Chessell Buckler in 1827 in The Piggott Collection. It was also described in February 1849 by Sir Stephen Glynne (SMR 882) as a \"plain church, comprising a nave with north aisle, chancel, west tower and north porch\" which had Early English, Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic features (McGarvie 1994, 34-35).\r\nSt. John was demolished again in 1853 to allow the building of a new church. This was designed by John Norton and was completed in 1855 (Dawson 1981, 21).\r\nThe church was gutted as a result of bombing in 1941. The rebuilding was delayed and a decision not to rebuild the church was taken in 1954. The remains of the church were cleared in 1966 and Bristol City Council bought the churchyard in 1973 (Crossley-Evans 2000, 80).\r\nThe churchyard was surveyed in 1980 by the Action Group for Bristol Archaeology in advance of clearance of the memorials for the creation of a public open space from the cemetery (Dawson in Thomas 1979), with additional information being recorded subsequently by Williams (1981). The state of the archaeological stratification on the site is unknown but deposits of high quality are very likely to survive. Dawson (1981) suggested that the site was worthy of designation as a Scheduled Ancient Monument."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The battery lay a short distance inland from the coast and occupied a roughly rectangular site of just over 4.8 hectares, between the north-west side of St. Andrews Road and the railway. The site was operational from February 1940 until the end of the Second World War and formed part of the Bristol Gun-Defended Area (GDA). The site was initially manned by 206th Heavy Anti Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery which had been replaced by 98th Heavy Anti Aircraft Regiment (Territorial) by November 1939.\r\nThe battery was laid out with four octagonal gun emplacements arranged around a central command post, which was unusual in comprising three separate structures. The magazine was sited on the north-west side and stands roughly 2.5 metres high. It is partially sunken and is protected by earth banks. Internally there are five rooms served by a corridor. The ancillary buildings - barracks, sick bay, stores etc. - lay just to the south-east, on the north-east and south-west sides of the access road which led into the site from St. Andrews Road to the east. The 98 HAA Regiment war diary for 9 November indicates flooding problems from heavy rain, recording that the mud on the site was nine inches deep. \"Drainage ditches are full to overflowing as the drainage system connecting with the sea sluices has fallen into bad repair.\"\r\nThe battery was initially equipped with four 3.7 inch Mark I static guns. However it had been re-equipped with four 4.5 inch guns by May 1941 (John Hellis pers. comm.) and had GL Mark II radar (which came into service in Spring 1941 and could detect approaching aircraft at a distance of around 30 miles) by June 1942. A short account together with a photograph of the emplacement in action was published in 1943 (Anon 1943, 44). The latter enhancement may have been the result of a Prime Ministerial directive of 27 February 1941 which gave priority to the defence of shipping during the Battle of the Atlantic (Dobinson 2001, 292). The radar mat appears to have been circular rather than octagonal and smaller than the usual diameter of 130 yards (Dobinson 2001). An earthwork visible on a 1946 vertical air photograph (CPE-UK-1869 3016) which probably represents the location of the mat (at ST 52342 80707) measured only 46 yards (42.2 metres) across. By May 1944 the 4.5 inch guns had been replaced with 3.7 inch Mark II guns.

The statue is by the Indian sculptor Niranjan Pradhan and comprises a figure of the Raja Rammohun Roy which faces west, and stands on a stone plinth.\r\nRam Mohum Roy Badahoor was born in Radhanagar, Bengal on 22 May 1772. He worked for the East India Company between 1804 and 1814 and learned Persian and English, which were the official languages of the Company's administrative structure. Roy had a strong interest in religious matters and learned Arabic, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew to further his studies of the fundamental texts of the great world religions. He held strongly to a monotheistic religious viewpoint, arguing against both Hindu worship of gods and goddesses and the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. In 1828 Roy founded the religious movement Brahmo Samaj (the Society of Brahma), the aim of which was to establish the worship of the Supreme Being. He also sought reform of the caste system and an improvement of the social status of women and children. In particular, with William Carey, he helped to persuade the Governor General of India, William Bentinck, to abolish suttee (the practice of burning a widow on her husband's funeral pyre) in 1829. In 1830, Roy became the envoy of the Emperor of Delhi to England. In April 1831 Roy arrived in England, primarily to witness the renewal of the East India Company charter, but he also attended the coronation of William IV. Roy travelled to Bristol in 1833 to visit Dr. Lant Carpenter, the Minister of the Unitarian Chapel at Lewin's Mead and father of the educational reformer Mary Carpenter. He stayed with other members of the Unitarian congregation at Stapleton but developed symptoms of meningitis and died there on 27 September 1833. His remains were initially interred in Stapleton but were moved to Arno's Vale cemetery in 1843.\r\nThe statue was unveiled on 20 December 1997 by the Indian High Commissioner (Merritt 2002, 59).

The site was discovered during levelling of the ground in Filwood Park in 1982 and the exposed remains were subject to archaeological excavation that year by R. G. J. Williams (Williams 1983) of Bristol and Avon Archaeological Research Group (BAARG) (SMR 20253). The excavation recorded a rectangular enclosure bounded on two sides by ditches. A two-room rectangular building, with a probable hearth, stood at the north end of the enclosure and a gully ran north-south through the enclosure, which was apparently cobbled. To the east of the enclosed area was a small metalled area adjacent to a ditch aligned north-south. Iron and lead ores, coal, and \"the waste products of metal working\" (Williams 1983, 14) were recorded here. Parallel ditches ran south from the southern side of the enclosure towards a small stone building with \"substantial faced stone walls\" (ibid. 15) and an area of cobbling and flagstones roughly 75 metres from the main enclosure. It was suggested by the excavator that the cobbling and flagstones may have served as the base for a further building. To the west of this was \"an area of hardpacked burnt clay floor\" with \"a line of laid stones on the south side indicating a furnace, possibly a corn dryer\" (Williams 1983). A dump of pottery was found some 50 metres to the east of the enclosure. On the available evidence the excavator concluded that the site was probably a farmstead, occupied from the 1st-century A.D. until possibly the latter part of the 4th-century A.D., where some metalworking was also taking place (Williams 1983, 19).\r\nSubsequent evaluation and excavation in advance of development in the area of the park (SMR 20254; 20349) and at Inns Court Community Centre (SMR 20054; 20348) indicated that the settlement was more extensive than had been previously thought. Work at Inns Court in particular suggested that there was a substantial stone building of at least two ranges immediately west of the community centre. This building was apparently of higher status than those previously recorded in the area and surviving areas of internal stone flooring were found. A wide ditch separated this building from another stone building to the south, and this too had stone floors (Williams 1997, 77-79). The finds evidence may also indicate that the site may have had an origin in the Late Iron Age.\r\nThe areal extent of the settlement is currently undefined, although the features so far identified extend for a distance of over 400 metres from east to west."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

William Payne commissioned Humphry Repton to create a landscape park for his new house at Brentry Hill in 1802. The work was one of Repton's later commissions, relatively small in scale and taking the main house as the focus for the landscape. The Reptons placed the house carefully to exploit the topography of the site, emphasising the views of the Bristol Channel to the west and screening those of Westbury-on-Trym to the south by planting evergreen trees (Daniels 1999, 236). Repton created a grotto which is now lost, a view of the house from inside the grotto being published in 1803 (reproduced in Harding and Lambert 1994, 64). A mound with evergreen planting close to the drive has been suggested as its likely site (Land Use Consultants 1999, 7). When the work had been completed Repton wrote that \"few houses have been built with more attention to the situation and circumstances of the place than the villa at Brentry\" (Harding and Lambert, 1994 64). Repton's son John Adey Repton designed Brentry House at the same time, one of only two occasions where father and son produced complimentary designs. The house had passed into the hands of John Cave, a member of the Bristol banking family, by the early 1820s and Cave expanded both the house (by adding new ranges) and its grounds. This work took land from the fields on the south side of the original line of Charlton Road (part of which survives as a lane within the hospital) and created the new, existing, line to the south. An entry in the Gloucestershire Quarter Sessions records for 1825 confirms authorisation of this work and another, in the same year, its subsequent inspection and acceptance (Brett 1999). It has been argued that the sinuous carriage drive was created during the 1825 (Land Use Consultants 1999, 7) and the 1825 work appears to have cut the grotto off from the house, both physically and in terms of the landscape design. It may be for this reason that it was taken down. On the north side of the site is a quarried edge. The origin, date and purpose of this is uncertain but the suggestion has been made that it may represents diversion of a public path to enhance the privacy of the house and was undertaken either by Repton or by Cave (Land Use Consultants 1999, 7).\r\nThe landscape is included in the English Heritage Register of Historic Parks and Gardens where it has a Grade II listing although it has subsequently been altered by planting, building for the retreat and subsequently the hospital which occupied the site and the widening of Passage Road and the junction with Charlton Road which removed land from the park after the Second World War. Generally \"the early 19th century landscape has been respected. Demand for built space has clearly impinged on the landscape and the land use, but it is fortunate that the essential elements of the designed landscape have been relatively unaffected\" (Land Use Consultants 1999, 9).\r\nRelatively little of the pre-Repton landscape can be identified, but a possible trackway of unknown purpose runs north-east from the drive leading to Charlton Road (Brett 1999). In the area now occupied by St. Peter's Hospice an area of ridge and furrow was identified by Bryant (Bryant 1995)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The structure was commissioned by the Bristol merchant Thomas Farr, who then owned the manor of Henbury, and was designed by the Scottish architect Robert Mylne (1734-1811) who was employed between 1763 and 1772 to remodel the interior of Kings Weston House (SMR 755). The design has a wide, two-storey crenellated central tower with a flat roof, and three narrower but slightly taller towers attached at equal intervals around its circumference. The windows and other detailing is in a Gothick style, and each of the towers has window openings with shallow arched cinquefoil heads set in rectangular frames. There are blind cross arrow slits at the ground- and second-floor levels. The main entrance is at the centre of the south-east facing elevation. The building is constructed of Lias limestone rubble with limestone ashlar dressings. The three-tower form of the Castle was apparently inspired by Fort Belvedere, built in the early 1750s for Prince William Augustus, the Duke of Cumberland, at Shrubs Hill in Windsor Great Park (Pevsner 1958, 468). Unusually for such structures, the Castle was habitable and had a kitchen and drawing room. It was used as a summer house for entertaining.\r\nWhen Farr became bankrupt in the late 1770s he sold the Henbury manor to Dr. Denham Skeet, a Bath lawyer. The Castle and its setting were recorded in a number of drawings by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm made in the late 1780s (British Library Add. Mss. 15540 f.112-f.115), and Grimm's 1788 drawing of the building from south-west records a fence enclosing the immediate area around the building. In 1789 Skeet sold Blaise to John Scandrett Harford, a Bristol banker. Humphry Repton was commissioned by Harford to landscape the Blaise estate and in his Red Book of 1798 recommended raising one turret in order to \"give it more the character of a real castle at a distance\" (Red Book). The proposal was not, however, carried out. The site became a popular destination for day-trips by visitors to Bath at around this time (Daniel 1999, 230) and Blaise Castle is mentioned in Jane Austen's novella Northanger Abbey (written in 1798).\r\nThe Castle suffered neglect in the twentieth century and the structure deteriorated. Remedial works were undertaken in 1957 and the interior was largely removed at this time. In 2006 a new internal timber floor was inserted into the building.\r\nThe building has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/20/1361)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Excavations by Rahtz in 1957 revealed an occupation layer within the south rampart of the fort and showed the ditch of the west rampart to have been 5 feet 5 inches deep and over 15 feet wide.

Sir Robert Southwell bought the Kingsweston estate in 1679 and it was inherited by Sir Edward Southwell at his father's death in 1702. Southwell undertook some changes to the garden in 1709 and decided to rebuild the gabled house, commissioning Sir John Vanbrugh to design the new building c.1710. Many of Vanbrugh's original drawings are contained within the Kingsweston Book of Drawings, held by Bristol Record Office (and also published (Downes, 1967)). The foundations of the earlier house were apparently reused and Downes suggests, from the evidence of letters from Vanbrugh, that Vanbrugh was very willing to accommodate Southwell's opinions on the design (Downes 1987, 342-345). Building was completed in 1725, after Sir Edward Southwell's death.\r\nThe house is of limestone ashlar with a seven-window range. It has a U-shaped double-depth plan and is of two-storeys with attic and basement.. At the centre of the building, above the three central bays, is a chimney arcade comprising six square stacks linked by semi-circular arches on each side. Robert Mylne carried out alterations to the building between 1764 and 1775, changing the east and north elevations and reworking the decoration of the interior (Gomme et al. 1979, 107-111). Vanbrugh also designed a number of the service buildings close to the house including the brewhouse, Loggia - probably an extension to an earlier but now demolished garden building - archaeologically recorded by Bryant (Bryant, 1997), a banqueting house known as The Echo, now surviving only as a shell and the Penpole Gate which was demolished in 1952. The ice house (SMR 3163) lies some 150 metres to the north-east of the main house.\r\nThe interior of the house was remodelled for Edward Southwell by the architect Robert Mylne between 1763 and 1772.\r\nThe stable block was designed by Mylne in the 1760s (Gomme et al. 1979, 181).The landscape park and gardens designed for Edward Southwell are presumably recorded by a view of Kingsweston of 1712 by Kip but it is not clear to what extent these were redesigned for the new house or subsequently, nor what the quality of the archaeological preservation of these buildings is likely to be.\r\nThe house has a Grade I listing (Listed Building Number 901-1/24/1742).

The barrrow was 7 paces in diameter, one foot high, with slight traces of a surrounding ditch on the south. It was excavated by E. K Tratman in about 1924 when a probable primary cremation was found, with sherds of a bipartite urn about 12 inches high. Finds in the University of Bristol Spelaeological Society Museum. Tratman believed this barrow, and others on the hill (SMR 783, 784, 785), to be of an Iron age date, though C. W. Phillips (1947) considered it Late Bronze Age. Green briefly reviewed the dating evidence available for the barrows at Kingsweston Hill in considering a cairn he had excavated at Tickenham. On the basis of a re-examination of Tratman's pottery finds, which appeared to be from collared urns, Green concluded that \"in the absence of any structural grounds for considering the Kings Weston Hill barrows to be of Iron Age date\" the Kingsweston barrows were of Early Bronze Age origin (Green 1972-73, 43-44). Tratman replied to Green's reinterpretation, arguing that the interpretation of the pottery as Iron Age was questionable, the monuments had not necessarily been disturbed to any great extent in antiquity and that the argument that absence of structural grounds for an Iron Age date leads to the inference of a date in the Early Bronze Age was \"highly specious\". Tratman concluded that there was no good reason to redate the Kingsweston barrows until fresh evidence became available (Tratman 1975, 56-57)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

In the early-nineteenth century the building was refronted with ashlar stone. As part of this work full-height bow windows were added, the northern and southern bays each containing three sash windows on each floor. At the same time sash windows were inserted into the south wall of the southern room of the first- and second-floors in a similar position to that on the floor below, and presumably at the same date. A large kitchen was added to the north-west corner of the original building. Single-storey outbuildings of stone rubble bonded in a white lime mortar also appear to have been constructed to the west of the house at this date. In the late nineteenth century the chimneypiece, cornice and skirting of the northern room were replaced.\r\nIn the 1908 a larger, two-storey extension, a \"smoke room,\" was added to the south-west corner of the house (BRO Building Plans Vol.55 fo.11).

Bridges apparently lived in the house and at his death in 1733 he bequeathed the estate to his son William. William Bridges died in 1741 and the estate passed to his sisters Ann, married to William Champion and Mary. George Bridges widow Mary remarried (to Jacob Elton) in the year of his death but continued to live at Ashley Court until her death in 1775.\r\nThe house was refronted in a Classical style in the first half of the eighteenth century.

He worked for the East India Company between 1804 and 1814 and learned Persian and English, which were the official languages of the Company's administrative structure. Roy had a strong interest in religious matters and learned Arabic, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew to further his studies of the fundamental texts of the great world religions. He held strongly to a monotheistic religious viewpoint, arguing against both Hindu worship of gods and goddesses and the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. In 1828 Roy founded the religious movement Brahmo Samaj (the Society of Brahma), the aim of which was to establish the worship of the Supreme Being. He also sought reform of the caste system and an improvement of the social status of women and children. In particular, with William Carey, he helped to persuade the Governor General of India, William Bentinck, to abolish suttee (the practice of burning a widow on her husband's funeral pyre) in 1829. In 1830, Roy became the envoy of the Emperor of Delhi to England. In April 1831 Roy arrived in England, primarily to witness the renewal of the East India Company charter, but he also attended the coronation of William IV. Roy travelled to Bristol in 1833 to visit Dr. Lant Carpenter, the Minister of the Unitarian Chapel at Lewin's Mead and father of the educational reformer Mary Carpenter. He stayed with other members of the Unitarian congregation at Stapleton but developed symptoms of meningitis and died there on 27 September 1833. His remains were initially interred at Stapleton but were moved to Arno's Vale cemetery in 1843.\r\nThe tomb for Ram Muhum Roy at Arno's Vale was commissioned by Dwarkanath Tagore (1794-1846), grandfather of the poet Rabindranath Tagore who had become wealthy through joint business ventures with British traders. It was designed in 1842 by William Prinsep (1794-1874) who had travelled to India as a merchant in 1817 and studied painting there under the artist George Chinnery.\r\nThe tomb is designed as an open temple in a Romantic Indian style with a cruciform plan. It is constructed of Limestone ashlar and comprises a high plinth with twelve decorated columns in groups of three at each corner supporting a flat roof. At the centre of the roof there is a tall, square-based, pointed dome with pinnacles at the top and the corners, and stone leaves on the sides. Within the monument there is a rectangular ashlar limestone block with a carved inscription on its south-east face. The inscription reads:\r\n\"BENEATH THIS STONE REST THE REMAINS OF / RAJA RAMMOHUN ROY BAHADOOR, / A CONSCIENTIOUS AND STEADFAST BELIEVER IN THE UNITY OF THE GODHEAD, / HE CONSECRATED HIS LIFE WITH ENTIRE DEVOTION TO THE WORSHIP OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT ALONE, / TO GREAT NATURAL TALENTS, HE UNITED THROUGH MASTERY OF SEVERAL LANGUAGES / AND EARLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS ONE OF THE GREATEST SCHOLARS OF HIS DAY. / HIS UNWEARIED LABOURS TO PROMOTE THE SOCIAL, MORAL AND PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE / PEOPLE OF INDIA, HIS EARNEST ENDEAVOURS TO SUPPRESS IDOLATRY, AND THE RITE OF SUTTEE / AND HIS CONSTANT ZEALOUS ADVOCACY OF WHATEVER TENDED TO ADVANCE THE GLORY OF / GOD AND THE WELFARE OF MAN LIVE IN THE GREATFUL REMEMBRANCE OF HIS COUNTRYMEN. / THIS TABLET / RECORDS THE SORROW AND PRIDE WITH WHICH HIS MEMORY IS CHERISHED BY HIS DESCENDANTS. / HE WAS BORN AT RADHANAGARE IN BENGAL IN 1774, [sic] / AND DIED AT BRISTOL SEPTEMBER 27TH 1833.\"\r\nA ceremony is held annually on 27 September at the tomb to commemorate Roy's life.\r\nThe tomb has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building No.901-1/47/438)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

A sale document of 1926 refers to lawns, kitchen gardens, orchards, outbuildings, and a 70 foot long swimming pool (Boore 1995, 9). Boore reports that a \"wet\" cellar or possible ice-house lies beneath the entrance to the building, with access below the nursery doorway. The property was owned by the Courtney family from the late 1930s until the 1980s. The plot was then broken up and the gardens divorced from the main house. The present building is in use as a children's nursery (February 1995). It appears from the modern Ordnance Survey 1:1250 Landline plan that the northern buildings of the (?eighteenth-century) manor house were sited to the north of the present building, the site of No.149 Southmead Road."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

A field in Horfield named \"West Bartholomew Leaze\" was bought by the War Office in 1843 to construct a new barracks in response to the rioting in Queen Square in 1831 and more generally to a perceived threat to civil order from Chartism (Douet, 1988 112).\r\nThe foundation stone of Horfield barracks was laid on 3 June 1845. Construction was completed and the site brought into commission on 26 April 1847, at a cost of £57000. The barracks occupied a large rectangular parcel of land measuring some 260 metres from north-west to south-east by 170 metres. It was enclosed by a massive exterior wall of sandstone ashlar which, following the design principles of trace italienne, had bastions at the ends and the centre of the southern side. The barracks could accommodate four companies of infantry and two cavalry troops. Internally, the buildings were arranged around a central parade ground and included quarters for the infantry soldiers and cavalry troopers, quarters for officers together with ancillary buildings.\r\nA garrison church (SMR 3209), designed by the architect William Butterfield (who also worked on Horfield Church and designed Highbury Chapel), was constructed immediately to the south.\r\nNew buildings were constructed inside the barracks in 1873 and the field on the opposite side of Filton Road was acquired as a camping area for the Gloucestershire militia.\r\nFrom 1881 until 1940 the barracks was the main training depot for the Gloucestershire Regiment. The Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXII.05) published in 1903 suggests that an infant school for the barracks had been built to the north-west of the garrison church by the end of the nineteenth century.\r\nThe barracks was taken out of use after the Second World War and the barracks was demolished in 1966. Office buildings were constructed within the site and there was some associated reduction of the ground level. Most of the original buildings associated with the barracks appear to have been demolished at this time. However, the barracks wall which surrounded the site is largely extant, particularly in the north-west corner and on the south side of the site where it appeared to be intact. In other locations, particularly on the north side of the barracks, the wall has been significantly reduced in height. Two War Department boundary stones recorded by the Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan survive on the Filton Road frontage.\r\nThe barracks chapel is also extant and has a Grade II listing (Listed Building number 901-1/53/1411)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The monument was excavated in 1924 by E. K. Tratman. Round barrow was 10 feet in diameter by 1 foot high. Finds in University of Bristol Spelaeological Society Museum include a single fragment of burnt human bone from near the centre of the barrow, a possible quartzite hammer-stone and a portion of a Roman mortarium. Tratman says the barrows (SMR 784, 785, 786) on Kingsweston Hill are Iron Age although in a later volume he describes this barrow as probably Roman. Green briefly reviewed the dating evidence available for the barrows at Kingsweston Hill in considering a cairn he had excavated at Tickenham. On the basis of a re-examination of Tratman's pottery finds, which appeared to be from collared urns, Green concluded that \"in the absence of any structural grounds for considering the Kings Weston Hill barrows to be of Iron Age date\" the Kingsweston barrows were of Early Bronze Age origin (Green 1972-73, 43-44). Tratman replied to Green's reinterpretation, arguing that the interpretation of the pottery as Iron Age was questionable, the monuments had not necessarily been disturbed to any great extent in antiquity and that the argument that absence of structural grounds for an Iron Age date leads to the inference of a date in the Early Bronze Age was \"highly specious\".

Their changes were not considered successful, however, and the architect George E. Street (1824-1881) carried out further restoration work between 1874 and 1877. Several of the windows were reglazed with stained glass in the later nineteenth century, though John Harford donated some Flemish glazing dating to the sixteenth century, which is now in the vestry.

The arch was constructed in the early-eighteenth century as part of an avenue of trees (SMR 21899) leading from Cotham Road to Redland Court (SMR 3973) and framed the house from Cotham Road while terminating the view from the house to the south-east. It is not currently (23/03/2004) clear whether the arch is of the same date as Redland Court or was constructed as part of Thomas Paty's scheme for the addition of pavilions to the house. It was not recorded by Jean Rocque's 1742 plan of Bristol but was, however, in existence by April 1746 when it was drawn by James Stewart (SMR 21901). The arch consisted of a central segmental arch with ashlar voussoirs and a cornice with crenellations above. On the north-east and south-west sides were flanking walls (without crenellation) reaching to the height of the springing of the central arch. These were terminated with two rusticated square columns with pyramidal heads. Between the rusticated bands there were narrow slits. The arch was orientated from south-west to north-east and was approximately 20 metres long and appears to have been around four metres high. It was still in existence in the late 1820s and was recorded by John Plumley and George Ashmead's 1828 plan of Bristol as a \"castellated arch\" (SMR 21900). The arch had been demolished by the early 1880s and its site now lies mainly beneath the highway of Cotham Grove."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Later a parcel of land was bought from Whitehall Colliery. There was an informal opening on 18 July 1894 after which designs for the layout of the park were invited. The winning design was that submitted by T. Lawrence Lewis. This had as its main feature a lake around which paths were set, with straight walks focusing on a central bandstand. Originally this was planted with Chestnut trees but these failed to establish themselves and within a few years were replaced with London Planes. A wrought iron fence 5 feet 6 inches high surrounded the park. In 1897 the Bristol Corporation took over the park and completed the laying out, which was apparently progressing slowly because of financial restrictions. The bowling green was completed in 1907-08. A cannon was positioned immediately inside the main entrance.

St. James), located on the east side of Tower Hill. The church stands within a roughly square churchyard of approximately 4700 square metres on the south side of Jacob Street, and lay outside the area of the planned medieval suburb of Old Market. The church was first recorded in the late-twelfth century. The advowson belonged to Tewkesbury Abbey, which appears to have exercised its right to appoint through its cell St. James Priory (BUAD 1024M).\r\nThe church was built of Pennant sandstone in a random rubble construction with limestone ashlar detailing. Its original plan was cruciform, and the south transept now forms the base of the tower. However, little fabric from the twelfth-century church has been identified although the font, with a square scalloped basin, is Norman.\r\nThe church was extensively rebuilt in the early-thirteenth century and its plan altered, the tower being relocated at the south-east corner of the nave. The chancel, nave and the lower element of the tower are all extant components of this phase of construction (BUAD 84; Anon. 1862, 91).\r\nThe church underwent major alteration in the mid-fifteenth century. A north chancel aisle with an arch-braced roof was added and the upper part of the tower was rebuilt, presumably adding stages and giving the tower four stages in all. The south and east chancel aisles were refenestrated with Perpendicular Gothic tracery windows, and the nave was also reworked in a Perpendicular style. A waggon roof, with bosses, supported on carved corbels was added. A chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas had been established by 1473 (Wadley 1886, 148), and John Kemys and Robert fforthey also endowed chantries.\r\nSt. James priory was dissolved in January 1540 and the advowson of the rectory was acquired by Henry Brayne as part of his purchase of the St. James property in 1544. Kemy's Chantry and fforthey's chantry were dissolved in the late 1540s. Thomas Boode was then the incumbent of Kemy's chantry and Henrie Spendalle occupied fforthey's chantry (Maclean 1883-84, 235-236). As part of the liturgical reordering associated with the reformation, the stone altars and rood screen were removed. In February 1547 the parish had 514 parishioners (Maclean 1883-84, 235-236).\r\nA new pulpit and sounding board were added in 1631 and a small Baroque porch was also built on the north side of the nave in the seventeenth century. Several commemorative monuments also date to the seventeenth century, including a large wall monument to Henry Merrett (d.1692). \r\nThe Bristol Corporation had acquired the advowson of the parish by the early eighteenth century and the Rector of Winterbourne, Mr. William Cary, was vicar with Thomas Jones serving as curate. The parish was reported to have 263 houses in 1712, and 330 in 1735 (McGrath 1985, 45-46).\r\nThomas Bilbie of Chew Stoke, who later established a bell foundry at Cullompton in Devon, cast a new tenor bell weighing approximately 18 cwt 2 lb 0 oz in 1739.\r\nDrawings of the interior of the church made by James Stewart in April 1748 indicate that there was then a gallery in the north aisle. The high altar was enclosed by a Baroque altar rail with spiral balusters and behind there was a late seventeenth or early eighteenth century reredos with Tuscan columns with Corinthian capitals. The ring was increased to eight bells in 1789.\r\nBy 1759 Carew Reynell was vicar by 1759, with Thomas Chapman as his curate, and was probably the initiator of alterations made to the nave in 1764. Reynell resigned when he  succeeded to the curacy of St. James and  James New became vicar in April 1772.\r\nBy 1822 William Day was vicar and was assisted by his son. Further alteration to the fabric took place in 1836. Projecting nave wings were built to house staircases to the galleries, new porches were built on the north side of the church and there was some refenestration. The church was restored in 1850 by the architect William Armstrong, of Brunswick Square, whose staff included E. W. Godwin. Godwin noted that the tower was then in a \"neglected and damaged\" state and was in use as \"a place of deposit for lumber\" (Anon. 1862, 91). The galleries were removed in 1876. The reredos was also replaced in the nineteenth-century.\r\nIn 1907 works were undertaken to allow the north aisle to be used for worship. This entailed the movement of the remaining fragment of a medieval stone effigy of a recumbent knight in armour in the Kemys, or chapel, aisle, from the eastern end of the south side to a site within the most easterly panelled arch on the same side (Pritchard 1907, 223-224). In 1914 The 1739 Bilbie tenor bell was used to provide metal for a new bell (weighing 19 cwt  0 lb 11 oz) cast by Llewellin and James of Castle Green. \r\nLater in the twentieth century a single-storey extension was added to the south-east corner of the church.\r\nThe church has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/40/298)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The dock was sited on the position of a graving dock, shown on Rocque's 1742 map, which was apparently created in the early eighteenth century when the harbour was tidal. The dock was subsequently turned into a dry dock by the addition of a pair of lock gates and, Plumley and Ashmead's 1828 map suggests, the building of stone walls. Part of the dock wall was recorded during an archaeological evaluation in 1997 (BUAD 3300) which was constructed of Pennant sandstone bonded in a off-white mortar. A layer of yellow/brown silty clay was found which the excavator suggested may have been a working surface for the dock (Cox, 1998). The dock had a number of associated structures.\r\nThe Teast family took over running of the dock between about 1790 and 1832.

The foundation date of the church is uncertain but the dedication to St. Thomas a Beckett (who was murdered in 1170) implies a foundation date near the end of the twelfth century. The church was a chapel of ease to St. John in Bedminster. The churchyard (BUAD 526M) had been established on the north side of the church by the end of the thirteenth century.\r\nThe original internal plan of the church and its medieval development is poorly understood. Documentary evidence records several chapels within the church including chapels dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St. Nicholas by the late fourteenth century (Wadley 1886, 5; 18), as well as one to St. John the Baptist in the first half of the fifteenth century (Wadley 1886, 134). In 1547 there were four chantry chapels - Chepe's, Welle's, Burton's and Stooke's (Maclean 1883-84, 234-235). Welles Chauntry is known to have been founded the early 1330s under the terms of the will of Richard of Wells and was endowed with two halls, the the adjacent shops and other appurtenances (Scott Holmes 1896, 162-163).\r\nThe church was substantially rebuilt in the fifteenth century, including the tower and in 1543-44 stone reclaimed from the buildings of the Carmelite friary in St. Augustine's Place was used for further repairs (Skeeters 1993, 81). The main evidence for the internal organisation of the medieval and early modern church is James Stewart's 1749 drawing of the interior (BUAD 2748), made prior to the rebuilding. This shows the church consisting of a nave, chancel and two aisles, with a lantern above the fourth bay eastward of the nave, and transepts to either side. A new reredos was constructed in 1716. The west wall of the lantern was decorated with complex blank arcading. At the west end of the nave was an organ, behind a screen of classical design. The nave roof was vaulted, there was a pulpit with tester, and iron gates led to the sanctuary. An organ was built according to a specification by John Harris in 1728-1729. The church appears to have had similar proportions in plan to its replacement.\r\nIn 1789 structural weaknesses were identified and it was decided to rebuild the church. Work began that summer, following a design by James Allen, and had been completed by December 1793 (Ison 1952, 84-88). The fifteenth century tower was retained but much of the medieval detailing seems to have been salvaged for buildings elsewhere in the city. A window from the old church was sold to Mr.Charles Joseph Harford, who installed it in his Pleasure Grounds at Stapleton Grove, Stapleton. The font from the old church was acquired by a Mr. Parrington of the White Lion Inn, St. Thomas Street, but was unfortunately broken on later removal (G. W. Braikenridge notes, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery). The 1716 reredos was retained, however. The organ was repaired by John Smith senior of the Bristol organ builders John Smith and Sons in 1825.\r\nIn the nineteenth century the tower was altered, and later restored. Burial within the church and chancel was ended by an Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852. In 1896 the interior was reworked by the architect Hugh Roumieu Gough (1843-1904).\r\nThe church was declared redundant in 1956 and was vested in the Redundant Churches Fund in 1988. A fire in the 1990s destroyed the Harris organ and it was replaced with the organ from St. Werburgh's Church. Three short sections of pipe from the earlier organ are currently (23/10/2006) stored in a cupboard created in the northern entrance to the gallery from the tower. The tower retains a ring of eight bells, the earliest of which is reported to date to the fifteenth century.\r\nSome parts of the late-medieval church have probably survived beneath the floor (BUAD 226) and within the fabric of the walls (BUAD 3273). When the wall of the south aisle of St. Thomas was replastered in 1881 C. J. Taylor, then the incumbent, noted the discovery of \"the detached shaft of a pillar and a stone fixed by a [illegible] that seemed to be the drain pipe from a piscina\" (BUAD 3273; BRO FCP/St.T/R/1b). Excavation in September 1916 is reported to have revealed the base for a respond, drawn by William Venn Gough, and the original fifteenth-century floor-level, 1.5 metres below the existing floor (BUAD 226; Pritchard 1920, 144)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.
<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_450> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "The Church of St. Peter, located on the south side of Peter Street. The church is traditionally held to be the oldest church in Bristol and it was first recorded in 1107 when the advowson was granted to Tewkesbury Abbey (Johnson & Cronne 1956, 73-74). Tewkesbury Abbey appears to have exercised its right to appoint through its cell St. James Priory (BUAD 1024M). William Worcestre, writing in 1480, recorded that the church was 54 steps long, omitting the choir, and 30 steps wide (Neale 2000, 134-135).\r\nThe church has aisles on the north and south sides of an unclerestoryed nave, each aisle separated from the nave by a four-bay arcade of Perpendicular arches supported by clustered columns, possibly of marble or some other polished stone. The nave has a square three-stage tower at its west end. The building is constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble with limestone ashlar dressings. There has not yet been a detailed archaeological analysis and phasing of the structure. However, the majority of the fabric appears to date to the fifteenth century.\r\nThe north aisle is of seven bays, articulated by buttresses, with a deep plinth. The aisle is lit by five-light windows, though there is a large chamfered bullseye window in the central bay. The penultimate bay at the west end is windowless. An octagonal stair tower projects from the north wall of the aisle against the buttress of the second bay from the east. The south aisle is wider than the north aisle and is of six bays with wide five-light windows between the projecting buttresses. It has a five-light late-Perpendicular east window which is blind below the transom. The west ends of both aisles are gabled, and there is a narrow three-light window in the north side, and a five-light window in the south.\r\nThe tower is flush with the west ends of the aisles and has ashlar quoins. In the west wall there is a wide Perpendicular arched doorway. Above there is a three-light window with a small two-light window in the second stage. The belfry has a two-light louvred window, a cornice with gargoyles on the corners and a crenellated parapet with crocketed pinnacles. The fabric of the lower element of the tower is thought to be of twelfth-century (or possibly earlier) date.\r\nRelatively little is currently known about the organisation of the interior of the church during the medieval period. The church appears to have had a number of chapels; in 1395 William Poynez instructed that he was to be buried in the \"chapel of the blessed Mary, before the image of St. George\" (Wadley 1886, 55). A survey of the chantries in the church in 1548 recorded that one John Williams had established an anniversary there \"att the awlter of o[ur] ladie of Belhousse\" (Maclean 1883-84, 240-241). Behind the Newton tomb was a piscina. There was a brass to Master Robert Lond, chaplain (d.1461) and other brasses are recorded. In 1845 a finely decorated canopied niche [1005A] was found at the west end of the north aisle and during repair works in 1901 a Gothic doorway on the north side of the chancel, a piscina [1004A], and a suspected credence niche were found (Pritchard 1904, 131-132).\r\nAfter the dissolution of St. James, the advowson of the rectory was acquired by Henry Brayne as part of his purchase of the St. James property in 1544. By the mid- sixteenth century there were 400 parishioners (Maclean, 1883-84 240) and the early-modern period is known to have seen a number of alterations to the fabric. At the east end of the south aisle south wall a large monument to Lady Antholin Newton of Barr's Court was erected in the 1570s or 1580s; against much of the east wall of the same aisle was a large monument to Alderman Robert Aldworth (d.1634) and his wife Martha (d.1619) (BRSMG M2667; Stoddard, 2001 35). Between the Newton and Aldworth monuments was the effigy of a priest. A substantial and ornate oak reredos was constructed in 1697 (Dening 1923, 121-123) and in 1698 the pews in the church were replaced with box pews which were still in place in the early nineteenth century (BRSMG M2670; Stoddard 2001, 34). In 1729 the peal of eight bells in the tower was recast by Abraham Rudhall. In 1912 a highly decorative Gothic traceried choir screen was erected. In the late-nineteenth or early-twentieth century a memorial to the poet Richard Savage (c1697-1743) was fixed to the exterior wall of the south aisle. The memorial bears the legend \"IN MEMORY OF RICHARD SAVAGE/POET BURIED NEAR THIS SPOT/ AUG 2nd 1743.\" A boiler house was created beneath the west end of the south aisle (now filled in).\r\nSt. Peter's was one of the city centre churches gutted by bombing on the night of 24/25 November 1940. After the war the structure was stabilised, the base of the tower and arcades being reinforced with concrete, and left as a shell without a roof or reglazing. The Newton and Aldworth monuments were left in situ, suffering damage from weathering. In 1958 the Aldworth tomb was removed and elements placed in the collections of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. The Newton tomb was moved into St. Nicholas Church museum in 1969. The church was subsequently designated as a memorial to the Second World War by Bristol City Council. On the west wall of the church is an inscribed slate plaque bearing the legend: \"IN/MEMORY OF THE/CITIZENS OF BRISTOL/AND/SURROUNDING AREAS/WHO DIED/IN THE BLITZ/DURING/THE 1939-1945 WAR\".\r\nThe church has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/40/184)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

Interest in establishing a new theatre in Bristol emerged in 1764 and a group of 34 individuals including councillors and business people (notably Henry Cruger, George Daubney, Joseph Harford, Richard Champion and William Champion) each took a £50 share (Barker 1974, 6-7) and a further ten subscribers were admitted to the group on 30 May 1766 (BRO 8976 (15)). An executive committee was formed and a plot of land on the north side King Street and two houses on Rackhay to the east were purchased. One of these was demolished to provide a side access to the theatre. The committee was heavily influenced by the design of Wren's Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, London and commissioned James Saunderson, carpenter at the Drury Lane who had designed a theatre then being built at Richmond, to produce plans (Barker 1974, 8). The architect Thomas Paty was appointed to supervise the construction work (Priest 2003, 68). The foundation stone was laid on 30 November 1764 and the building appears to have been finished in the spring of 1766.\r\nThe theatre was named the New Theatre and opened on 30 May 1766 with a performance of Sir Richard Steele's play \"The Conscious Lovers\" by the contracted company led by William Powell. As constructed, the main body of the theatre was a rectangular structure of stone rubble with a hipped roof some 20 metres to the north of King Street and the main entrance appears to have been off King Street, through the seventeenth-century house, No.38 King Street (BUAD 232M). Attached to the front of this building was a square portico extending over the footway of King Street and supported at its south-west and south-east corners by Roman Doric columns. At the centre of the south side was a pediment. Internally it had a raked stage with the stage machinery accommodated beneath. The auditorium had nine dress boxes and two circles. At the rear of the stage there were dressing rooms, two at each corner (one above the other), while there were two further dressing rooms at the north end of the basement. The space above the auditorium was used as the scenery workshop, the scenery flats being changed using wooden rails or grooves (Southern in Booth 1975, 69-79; Cooke 2002). The Green Room was sited in an element projecting east into Rackhay. The interior decoration was by Michael Edkins, known as a Bristol ceramic artist. Little is known of the Edkins decorative scheme although \"carving, painting and gilding, executed with much taste\" was used throughout. There was a frieze of triglyphs above the boxes. The partitions between the boxes were marked by pilasters and their fronts were apparently painted in green and gold (Barker 1974, 12). Internally the boxes were reported to have been papered with flock wallpaper and  The lighting throughout was from tallow candles. Barker estimated that the eighteenth-century theatre had a house of approximtely 1000, with around 320 seats in the Pit, over 250 in the Gallery, 267 seats in the dress circle and 148 in the upper circle (Barker 1974, 13).\r\nEdkins was employed to repaint parts of the interior in 1774 and in a lease of 1779 required the new lessee, John Palmer who also managed the Theatre Royal in Bath, to \"make an entire alteration in the theatre, enlarge the lobby, [and] to build an elegant tea room and other accommodations.\" In 1788 a Royal licence was granted and the theatre was renamed the Theatre Royal. The theatre was the subject of another round of significant alteration around 1790 when the ceiling was raised and the whole interior redecorated and re-gilded. A new lease was granted in John Palmer in 1799 and Palmer undertook alterations which included the construction of the gallery and the associated sloping of the auditorium ceiling. At the same time the boxes were fitted in the Upper Circle. In 1820 William Edkins, Michael Edkins son, was commissioned by the lessee William M'Cready to redecorate the boxes. M'Cready had the proscenium arch rebuilt in March 1824 and then removed entirely in the autumn of 1826.\r\nIn 1853 under a new lessee, J. H. Chute, the stage was enlarged by extending the building into the yard on its north side and new stage machinery was installed. Beneath the stage were two post traps, a grave trap or Hamlet trap, and bridges (lightweight timber frames which could be raised to stage level). Fixed to the roof trusses were a metal pulley wheels and winch for the safety curtain. The theatre was refurnished and redecorated as part of the project. Another substantial refurbishment was undertaken in 1881 in accordance with plans by C. J. Phipps and T. Pope and this saw the reduction of the size of the stage by five feet [1.53 metres], the addition of new stage traps and the alteration of the proscenium arch. Another scheme of redecoration was also implemented and the present ceiling of the auditorium, much of the extant plasterwork on the cornices of the pillars and the fronts of the boxes survives from this work.\r\nBy 1891 the buildings which formed the entrance to the theatre had become structurally unstable and were demolished in 1903 to enable construction of a new entrance. This was designed by W. Skinner and was a two-storey, four-bay structure of brick. At ground-floor the western three bays formed an arcade of segmental-headed arches, the two western bays forming entrance doors for patrons. The eastern bay was a double-width entrance or haulingway. A glass pentice roof protected the public entrance from the elements and the fenestration at first-floor level comprised sash windows with segmental pediments. Over these was a string course and overhanging cornice with a parapet above.\r\nBy the early 1940s the theatre was suffering serious financial decline and a public campaign was launched to establish a trust and purchase the building. This was successful and a series of renovations were made under the direction of the architect J. Ralph Edwards. The theatre reopened on 11 May 1943 (Barker 1974, 204-205).\r\nThe theatre was subject to major alteration in 1970 in a scheme by the architect Peter Moro. The 1903 entrance was demolished and the next door Coopers' Hall (BUAD 16M), gutting the building, was incorporated into the theatre. Despite the status of the building as a Scheduled Ancient Monument the original stage was rebuilt and the Georgian dressing rooms at the back of the stage were demolished. A modernist studio theatre, designed by the project architect Michael Heard, was constructed at the western end of the site and a new foyer and first floor gallery were inserted into the Coopers' Hall. The basement was also lowered.\r\nThere have been major architectural surveys of the building, made in 1942 by J. Ralph Edwards (BUAD 919) and in 1969 by the Ministry of Works (BUAD 4112). The latter includes an extensive photographic survey of the 1850s stage equipment. The theatre is a rare survival of a Georgian town theatre and is the earliest with any surviving interior in the United Kingdom. It is also thought to be the oldest theatre in the country to have been in continuous theatrical use.\r\nThe building has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/624)."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

No brief was given, only a plan of the site, and the finished work cost £6000. The sculpture is a stainless steel structure with a mild steel armature set on a large rectangular area of landscaping of black engineering bricks. The design comprises six triangular aerodynamic forms with straight and parabolic edges linked together. Mount said that the design was \"derived from a combination of sail shapes and equestrian forms.\" A scale model was tested in a wind tunnel by Professor Joseph Black of the School of Engineering, University of Bath. Black had performed the wind tunnel tests on Concorde and Mount was guided on the finishing of the metal surfaces by Amos Underhill of Coventry who had polished the prototype turbine blades for the Concorde engines.\r\nMount erected the sculpture on the site in the summer of 1971 with the assistance from Christine Feiler.

<http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/resource/Bristol_Monuments.csv/row_670> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/definition/monument_desc> "Bristol Bridge (1247). In 1247 a stone bridge was built across the river Avon between Redcliffe and the High Street/Balwin Street junction to replace an earlier - possibly wooden - bridge. The main structure of the bridge was apparently constructed of Pennant sandstone bonded in a red sandy mortar (BUAD 431; Price in Thomas 1979, 29-33) and had four arches supported by three piers. The central pair of arches, as recorded by a drawing of c.1760 from the downstream side of the bridge (Seyer MS, Bristol Reference Library), were higher and wider than the arches at the northern and southern ends. Buttresses extended the full height of each pier and each pier had a cutwater at either end, that on the upstream side of the central pier extended up river to carry the Chapel of the Assumption (BUAD 667M) which arched over the carriageway. In 1480 William Worcestre measured the bridge and reports that it was 75 yards long by 5 yards wide (Neale 2000, 2-3) and cartographic sources suggest that the abutment extended further towards St. Nicholas Church, on the north bank of the river Avon, than does the present bridge (BUAD 305M).\r\nHouses lined both sides of the central carriageway of the bridge by the later fourteenth century (Veale 1938, 117-118) but the presence of domestic accommodation on the bridge may well date to its construction. The form of the medieval houses is not clear but they appear to have comprised a shop at ground floor with tenements above and William Worcestre gives a dimension of 10 yards for the buildings, presumably the width of the frontage (Neale 2000, 76-77). Some of the buildings were cellared (Veale 1938, 117-118), with the cellars presumably being cut into the piers. Worcestre records that there were five \"very strong\" stone arched cellars on each side of the bridge and a large vault beneath the Chapel of the Assumption. He also notes four cellars at either end of the bridge (Neale 2000, 12-13).\r\nThe evidence for the early-modern housing on the bridge is stronger and these houses were timber-framed, were of four storeys and attic, and many had full-width glazing. Most had gabled roofs, but a few were flat-roofed. The houses projected beyond the sides of the stone bridge, the overhang being supported by props. A vignette in the border of Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol appears to show windows in some of the cellars beneath the houses. The antiquarian Samuel Seyer reports that the form of some of the houses on Bristol Bridge comprised a shop with a small room behind at ground floor, the staircase behind the door. At first floor there was a parlour and usually the kitchen. The second and third floors had two bedchambers each and there were then two garrets above. Some had lead platforms (Seyer 1823, 33-43). The function of these platforms is at present (02/11/2001) unknown but contemporary illustrations suggest that their form is comparable to similar platforms on the roofs of Venetian houses. It is not, however, clear on what authority Seyer's description of the buildings rests. A fire on 17 February 1647 destroyed or damaged 24 of the houses on the bridge (Latimer 1900, 216; Toulmin-Smith 1872, 67) and two years later the Bristol Corporation ordered Walter Stephens, draper, to \"either pull down or repair the arch hanging over the highway leading over the bridge, which is very dangerous to all people travelling that way\" (Latimer 1900, 224). By the eighteenth century the bridge was extremely congested with vehicular traffic and the two outer sides of the bridge sloped towards the middle, adding to the problem (Marcy 1968, 152). When the bridge was replaced in the 1760s the medieval foundations were found to be sound enough to be re-used, and seem to have been encased within the replacement bridge (BUAD 350M). One of the foundations, itself apparently enclosing a timber pile, was noted by William Barrett (BUAD 2590) toward the end of the eighteenth century (Barrett 1789, 77). It is also likely that the remains of the pier bases of the medieval bridge survive in the bed of the Floating Harbour."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The building and the Llan House was turned into a single property in the 1880s when the photographer , William Harvey Barton, resident at Llan House on the north side of Rupert House expanded his business. The buildings seem to have been demolished in the mid-1960s."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The glass house was extant by 1700 when it was owned by Thomas Ewens who seems to have retained it until 1717.

It was then acquired by a Captain Wheeler, who ran it until 1723, and then by John Jones who held it until his death in 1740. His widow sold the works to Crosse and Berrow in 1750 and it was acquired by Little and Longman in 1761. Robert Vigor joined the business in 1767 and by 1775 it had become Vigor, Stevens and Hill. In 1802 the company amalgamated with Wadham Ricketts and Co. and documentary evidence indicates that in the early nineteenth century the works was producing glass bottles, some of which were being shipped to New York; a Braikenridge illustration of the 1820s shows the glass furnace with a wooden superstructure. The glasshouse appears to have closed down in the later 1820s.\r\nA single archaeological evaluation trench dug in 1989 (BUAD 446) found possible evidence of the glass works, including several stone walls as well as a brick floor covered with a blue, glassy substance.

The building was the first Methodist chapel to be built.\r\nGeorge Whitefield (1714-1770), a recently-ordained Anglican minister who began to evangelise in Bristol in early 1739, had quickly established two meetings of followers based at St. Nicholas Street and Baldwin Street. The New Room was established to support these two groups and the foundation stone of the building was laid on 12 May 1739 (Stell 1986, 68).\r\nThe building is a two-storey structure with rendered stone walls, a basement and hipped, pantile roofs. The original entrance to the building was at the north-east corner via a narrow alley, later known as Wesley Court, from Horsefair (Stell 1986, 68). Internally, the ground floor is occupied by the meeting-room which has a roughly rectangular, though irregular, plan measuring approximately 19.3 metres from north to south by 12.9 metres wide. There are galleries on the east and west sides and the pulpit, which has two desks and is enclosed by mahogany rails, stands against the north wall. The seating at ground-level is believed to have consisted of movable wooden benches. A clock (of c.1670 which had been purchased by his father, Samuel, in 1710) was donated by John Wesley and is fixed to the gallery rail of the west gallery. The first floor is supported by six Tuscan columns, forming aisles on either side of the meeting room and the room is lit by a large semi-circular arched windows and in the north and south walls, and other smaller windows together with an octagonal lantern which passes through the first floor rooms. The sides of the lantern contain windows to provide light to those rooms. The largest room on the upper floor is the Conference Room, approximately 9.2 metres long, with the lantern located towards the northern end. There is a row of four rooms on each side of the Conference Room which were used by preachers. John Wesley had the two rooms at the south-west corner, usually visiting the New Room three times each year, while other preachers used the remainder.\r\nIn April 1739 Whitefield, planning his second trip to the American colonies, invited John Wesley to Bristol to take over responsibility for the Bristol awakening in his absence. There was a strong theological disagreement between the two men over predestination and election, Whitefield adopting a Calvinistic position while Wesley was inclined towards Arminianism. On his arrival Wesley preached in defence of free will and thereby began to create a split amongst Bristol's Methodists. Despite this Whitefield nevertheless persisted with his intention of entrusting affairs to Wesley and sailed for the Americas in August 1739. Local Calvinist Methodists appealed to the Welsh evangelist Howel Harris (1714-1739) to defend their position. Wesley assured Harris that his views were compatible with those of Whitefield. However, in June 1740 Wesley expelled the advocates of predestination and took control of the New Room and the Kingswood school (Jones 2003, 80-82).\r\nThe New Room was altered in 1748. An extension was added to the south end and a new main entrance was created off Broadmead. A single-storey lean-to structure, the Preachers Stable was constructed on the east side of the entrance. It is not currently (26/05/2006) known whether the courtyard to the south of the building was created as part of this work or whether it already existed, although a stone screen separating it from Broadmead was probably built at this time. This was of squared, coursed Lias stone with limestone ashlar dressings and at the centre was an elliptical arch with wrought-iron gates and an urn finial above. The original entrance appears to have been blocked off and a small vestry, the Conference Room, created in the north-east corner of the meeting-room. A small square limestone ashlar panel at first-floor level on the east side of the north elevation of the building which celebrates its foundation John Wesley in 1739 may also have been fixed at this time.\r\nIn 1792 the Portland Chapel (BUAD 257M) was opened in Portland Street, Cotham to serve the growing number of Methodists living on the north side of the city and reduced the numbers attending services in the New Room. Two years later the New Room congregation split over the question of ordination as a requirement for the administration of commmunion and a new chapel, the Ebenezer Chapel (BUAD 258M) was established on the western side of Old King Street by those who left the meeting. This further weakened the New Room and in 1808 it was sold to Welsh Calvinistic Methodists.\r\nThe Welsh Methodist congregation retained the building until the late 1920s, adding wooden pews. In 1929 the building was purchased by Edmund Sykes Lamplough (1860-1940), deputy-chairman of Lloyd's of London, who then gave it to the Methodist Conference. The building was restored under the supervision of the architect Sir George Oatley. Oatley designed new wooden pews and an organ made by John Snetzler of London in 1761 was purchased in c.1929 from Little Plumstead Church in Norfolk. After refurbishment the organ was installed in the gallery in 1930. An equestrian statue of John Wesley was erected in the Broadmead courtyard on the south side of the building in c.1932 (BUAD 1668M). In 1939 a statue of Charles Wesley (BUAD 1669M) was placed in The Horsefair courtyard on its north side.\r\nThe remains of Captain Thomas Webb (c.1720-1796), influential in the establishment of Methodism in North America, and his wife were reinterred in the Broadmead coutyard to the south of the building when the Portland Chapel was closed in 1972.\r\nInvestigation of the building has been limited. It was surveyed by A. Barbara Coates of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England (RCHME) in 1944 (BUAD 956; Stell 1986, 66-68) and was re-examined by Christopher Stell of RCHME in the 1980s (Stell 1986, 66-68).\r\nThe building has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/40/481). The screen wall on the Broadmead frontage is listed Grade II (Listed Building number 901-1/40/477). The statues of John Wesley (Listed Building number 901-1/40/480) and Samuel Wesley (Listed Building number 901-1/40/484) are also listed Grade II."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

During renovation in 1736 the cone collapsed (General Advertiser 4 June 1736) and was rebuilt. The business was bought by Isaac Elton in 1746 and passed to his son. By the beginning of the nineteenth-century the glassworks was suffering from the more general decline which affected Bristol glass bottle manufacture. It was leased in 1804 and again in 1807 and finally sold in 1809 to a partnership which demolished the cone to set up a spelter, copper and wire manufacturing business.\r\nA plan on deeds dating to 1807 suggests that the pot rooms for the glassworks were to the south of the cone and on the east side of Cheese Lane."^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> <http://datadock.io/kal/xmlss_data/id/dataset/Bristol_Monuments.csv>.

The soil is marshy, and the whole in a very dirty and neglected state, being used as the back premises of the dwelling-house through which it is entered\" (Clark 1850, 165). An Order in Council of 18 February 1854 made under the Burial Act of 1852 imposed the restriction that \"only one body [was] to be buried in each grave\" in the burial ground and the cemetery was shown as disused on the 1st edition Ordnance Survey map of the early 1880s.
