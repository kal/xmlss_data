								St. Peter's Hospital, lying on the south side of St. Peter's Churchyard. The property belonged to the Norton family from 1402, and its frontage was measured at 75 paces by William Worcestre in 1478. The medieval form of the building is unclear but the seventeenth-century ranges abutted an earlier, medieval, two-storey range with at least three bays. The arch-braced roof with wind braces over the room later known as the Court Room was also of medieval date (Simpson 1926, pl.9).<br />
The building was acquired by the merchant Robert Aldworth in 1607 as his residence and was refronted by him in 1612-1613. The building was at that date a four-bay jettied structure with gabled pantile roofs. The north-west facing elevation had a timber frontage with elaborate decoration, including carved jettying and carved bargeboards. The porch on the south side of the structure was internally decorated with carved wooden friezes. These were drawn by Samuel Loxton in the early twentieth century (Bristol Reference Library A34) and also photographed in the 1920s. Internally the Court Room had a decorative plasterwork ceiling and frieze, both apparently of seventeenth-century date. It also had a full height chimney-piece with a frieze beneath the mantel and a decorated overmantel with what appear to have been the Royal Arms flanked by two female figures in the central panel. It had carved phoenixes on either side of the fireplace.<br />
After Aldsworth's death in 1634 the building was used as a sugarhouse, believed to be the first in Bristol and to have been refining Madeira cane. During the Commonwealth the building became a mint.<br />
In 1696 a union of the parish poor relief functions, the Corporation of the Poor, was formed after the passage of an Act of Parliament (Butcher 1932, 179-187). This was managed by a committee and housing both adults and orphaned or abandoned children, who were taught knitting, spinning and sack-making - products being sold to provide income for the Corporation. The four western bays of Aldsworth's house were taken over and became known as St. Peter's Hospital (also known as the Mint Workhouse). The building was the administrative centre for the Corporation of the Poor and its records were held there. It also provided accommodation "to the Number of three or fourscore Persons, young and old, chiefly Children" (Anon., 1732) for some of those in the care of the Corporation. However, the majority were either in receipt of outdoor relief (distributed weekly at the hospital) or were accommodated at other sites around Bristol.<br />
The hospital continued to operate until it was destroyed by bombing on 24-25 November 1940 when both the fabric of the building and the hospital's records were lost. The site has not since been redeveloped and the rear wall of the range of buildings survives.<br />
John Pritchard monitored the construction of a new Board Room in 1900 which involved the removal of some seventeenth-century fabric (BUAD 204; Pritchard 1900, 271-272) and a survey was made by Simpson two decades later (BUAD 531; Simpson 1926). However, there has been little archaeological work on the site since the destruction of the building, although a watching brief on landscaping works was carried out by Dr. Roger Price in 1972 (BUAD 63).
