								St. John the Baptist (sometimes known as St. John on the Wall). The parish church (and town gate) was built on the line of the Norman town wall during the twelfth century. The church is thought to have been founded c.1192 and the advowson of the rectory was in the gift of Tewkesbury Abbey.<br />
The rector of St. John in 1420 was John Mybbys, probably the former principal of Cuthbert Hall, Oxford who had participated in the Lollard rising led by Sir John Oldcastle in the spring of 1414. In August 1420 he acted as compurgator for William Taylor during the latter's trial on six charges of heresy (Thomson 1965, 25n).<br />
C14 and C15; late sixteenth-century vestry; narthex and side gateways formed later 1820s. Rubble with limestone dressings and limestone ashlar tower and spire. <br />
Nave, chancel and east vestry. Tower over gateway (originally shared with St.Lawrence). Perpendicular Gothic style.<br />
The north elevation includes at the east end St John's conduit, beneath a nineteenth-century four-centred arch; above is a fifteenth-century canted oriel window; to the west is an octagonal chimney on a corbel; a deep drip over the C14 crypt of 6 bays, refenestrated with low, C15 three-light Tudor-arched windows, the west one blocked, and a small Tudor-arched ribbed door; 2-bay late C15 chancel of 3-light windows with a shallow buttress in between; C14 four-bay nave of larger 3-light windows, and a short 4-light Tudor-arched clerestory window above the first bay, with a crenellated parapet. <br />
South elevation of the chancel is 3 bays, windows as the north side with 2 doorways at either end with chamfered Tudor arches; at the west end of the chancel the nave steps out and is linked by an angled wall on corbels; the south nave wall is similar to the north, without the crypt windows. <br />
At the west end is the gateway. The south side of the central gateway has flanking niches with painted statues of Brennus and Bellinus, the mythical founders of Bristol, each holding an orb and sceptre; shields and a Royal Arms to the parapet above; the east arch is paired with the entrance to the church. <br />
The main gateway has a ribbed fan vault with bell hole, also portcullis slot. The two-stage tower has an octagonal spire. <br />
At lower level there is a crypt or crowde [969A] in 2 sections: that to the east is 3 bays, a tierceron vault with bosses; west section is 2 bays, with a more complex tierceron ribbed vault with bosses but no shafts; 2 stoops, by door and in south-west corner with a projecting shield. The crowde was illustrated by Rowbotham in 1826, with views from both ends (M2425-M2426).<br />
A two-bay chancel with relief crenellation across the middle of east wall, and 3 fine Tudor-arched studded doors with raised lozenges in panels; an arch and steps up behind the south chancel arch pier to the pulpit; 6-bay nave has splayed window reveals and attached shafts between the bays, with painted octagonal capitals; the raised east bay has clerestory windows to former rood loft and a C15 roof with tie beams and posts to angel corbels, while the rest has a timber cornice to a shallow C15 arch-braced collar beam roof; narthex with open-well stair of 1883 to the organ loft.<br />
After the dissolution of St. James, the advowson of the rectory was acquired by Henry Brayne as part of his purchase of the St. James property in January 1544.<br />
Fine Laudian fittings. A gated altar rail with twisted banisters, 2 lecterns, pews of 1621 with doors and a partially restored C17 west screen and organ loft with painted panels and fluted pilasters; brass 2-sided lectern c1690, and a C18 wrought-iron sword rest; a fine 1624 font. A rare hour-glass (held in the City Museum) from the time of the Commonwealth is attached beside the octagonal pulpit. Various memorials include a wall tablet, the Rowley Brass, to Thomas Rowley d.1478, with inscribed figures; table tomb to Walter Frampton d.1388 in an elliptical-arched recess in the chancel. <br />
Walter Frampton was chief benefactor for St John's until his death in 1388. The crypt or crowde provided space for guild or chantry chapels, another example standing in the Church of St Nicholas (BUAD 147M).<br />
The interior was recorded by Rowbotham in 1826 (M.2396) and Johnson in 1828 (M2397). Both show the pulpit raised above the central gangway. Illustrations, also, of the font (O'Neill, M2402), communion table (Rowbotham M2406), hour-glass (O'Neill M.2411; M2411a), Frampton tomb (M2413-M2417), Rowley brass (M2420), other monuments and internal fittings, etc.<br />
An organ was built in 1846 by John Smith junior of the Bristol organ builders John Smith and Sons (Felix Farley's Bristol Journal, 21 February 1846).<br />
The church was declared redundant in 1984 and the congregation moved to the Chapel of the Three Kings of Cologne.<br />
The church has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number ).
