								The Church of St. Peter, located on the south side of Peter Street. The church is traditionally held to be the oldest church in Bristol and it was first recorded in 1107 when the advowson was granted to Tewkesbury Abbey (Johnson & Cronne 1956, 73-74). Tewkesbury Abbey appears to have exercised its right to appoint through its cell St. James Priory (BUAD 1024M). William Worcestre, writing in 1480, recorded that the church was 54 steps long, omitting the choir, and 30 steps wide (Neale 2000, 134-135).<br />
The church has aisles on the north and south sides of an unclerestoryed nave, each aisle separated from the nave by a four-bay arcade of Perpendicular arches supported by clustered columns, possibly of marble or some other polished stone. The nave has a square three-stage tower at its west end. The building is constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble with limestone ashlar dressings. There has not yet been a detailed archaeological analysis and phasing of the structure. However, the majority of the fabric appears to date to the fifteenth century.<br />
The north aisle is of seven bays, articulated by buttresses, with a deep plinth. The aisle is lit by five-light windows, though there is a large chamfered bullseye window in the central bay. The penultimate bay at the west end is windowless. An octagonal stair tower projects from the north wall of the aisle against the buttress of the second bay from the east. The south aisle is wider than the north aisle and is of six bays with wide five-light windows between the projecting buttresses. It has a five-light late-Perpendicular east window which is blind below the transom. The west ends of both aisles are gabled, and there is a narrow three-light window in the north side, and a five-light window in the south.<br />
The tower is flush with the west ends of the aisles and has ashlar quoins. In the west wall there is a wide Perpendicular arched doorway. Above there is a three-light window with a small two-light window in the second stage. The belfry has a two-light louvred window, a cornice with gargoyles on the corners and a crenellated parapet with crocketed pinnacles. The fabric of the lower element of the tower is thought to be of twelfth-century (or possibly earlier) date.<br />
Relatively little is currently known about the organisation of the interior of the church during the medieval period. The church appears to have had a number of chapels; in 1395 William Poynez instructed that he was to be buried in the "chapel of the blessed Mary, before the image of St. George" (Wadley 1886, 55). A survey of the chantries in the church in 1548 recorded that one John Williams had established an anniversary there "att the awlter of o[ur] ladie of Belhousse" (Maclean 1883-84, 240-241). Behind the Newton tomb was a piscina. There was a brass to Master Robert Lond, chaplain (d.1461) and other brasses are recorded. In 1845 a finely decorated canopied niche [1005A] was found at the west end of the north aisle and during repair works in 1901 a Gothic doorway on the north side of the chancel, a piscina [1004A], and a suspected credence niche were found (Pritchard 1904, 131-132).<br />
After the dissolution of St. James, the advowson of the rectory was acquired by Henry Brayne as part of his purchase of the St. James property in 1544. By the mid- sixteenth century there were 400 parishioners (Maclean, 1883-84 240) and the early-modern period is known to have seen a number of alterations to the fabric. At the east end of the south aisle south wall a large monument to Lady Antholin Newton of Barr's Court was erected in the 1570s or 1580s; against much of the east wall of the same aisle was a large monument to Alderman Robert Aldworth (d.1634) and his wife Martha (d.1619) (BRSMG M2667; Stoddard, 2001 35). Between the Newton and Aldworth monuments was the effigy of a priest. A substantial and ornate oak reredos was constructed in 1697 (Dening 1923, 121-123) and in 1698 the pews in the church were replaced with box pews which were still in place in the early nineteenth century (BRSMG M2670; Stoddard 2001, 34). In 1729 the peal of eight bells in the tower was recast by Abraham Rudhall. In 1912 a highly decorative Gothic traceried choir screen was erected. In the late-nineteenth or early-twentieth century a memorial to the poet Richard Savage (c1697-1743) was fixed to the exterior wall of the south aisle. The memorial bears the legend "IN MEMORY OF RICHARD SAVAGE/POET BURIED NEAR THIS SPOT/ AUG 2nd 1743." A boiler house was created beneath the west end of the south aisle (now filled in).<br />
St. Peter's was one of the city centre churches gutted by bombing on the night of 24/25 November 1940. After the war the structure was stabilised, the base of the tower and arcades being reinforced with concrete, and left as a shell without a roof or reglazing. The Newton and Aldworth monuments were left in situ, suffering damage from weathering. In 1958 the Aldworth tomb was removed and elements placed in the collections of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. The Newton tomb was moved into St. Nicholas Church museum in 1969. The church was subsequently designated as a memorial to the Second World War by Bristol City Council. On the west wall of the church is an inscribed slate plaque bearing the legend: "IN/MEMORY OF THE/CITIZENS OF BRISTOL/AND/SURROUNDING AREAS/WHO DIED/IN THE BLITZ/DURING/THE 1939-1945 WAR".<br />
The church has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/40/184).
