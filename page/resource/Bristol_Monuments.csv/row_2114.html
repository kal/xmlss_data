								Arno's Vale Cemetery, located on the south side of Bath Road. The western part of the site formed part of the estate of William Reeves, who owned the copper foundry at Crew's Hole, from 1740. Reeves built Arno's Court House (SMR 8467), the Bath House (SMR 20124), Black Castle (SMR 3498) and the gateway (Ison 1952). Elements of the designed landscape park survive (including some mature trees, boundary walls and the remains of a prospect mounds).<br />
In 1837 an Act of Parliament (1 Vict. Cap.cxxi) was obtained, enabling the creation of a cemetery company, the Bristol General Cemetery Company, and setting out the rules for its operation and for interment. It was to function as a private cemetery and was laid out following 1834 designs by James Loudon (Harding & Lambert 1994, 109). The entrance lodges, Church of England mortuary chapel (SMR 20122) and Nonconformist mortuary chapel (SMR 20123) were designed by Charles Underwood, a local architect. The cemetery opened in 1839 and in 1850 it was reported that the cemetery then covered a little over twenty-seven acres, of which more than eight acres was consecrated ground (Clark 1850, 220-224). Part of the cemetery was used for the interment of the remains of "several hundred" victims of the cholera epidemic of 1849 (Clark 1850, 220-224). A number of major figures were also interred at Arno's Vale in the nineteenth century. The remains of Raja Ram Mohum Roy Bahadoor (1772-1833), an Indian reform campaigner who died in Bristol, were interred in a tomb designed by the artist William Prinsep (1794-1874) in 1843. The educational reformer Mary Carpenter (1807-1877)  and the founder of the Muller orphanages, George Muller (1805-1898), were also buried there.The cemetery was enlarged by permission of Acts of Parliament in 1880 (43 and 44 Vict. Ch.lxxix) and 1891 (54 Vict. Ch.xi) which allowed the purchase of land adjoining the southern side of the cemetery, creating an area of approximately 45 acres in total. A further act in 1926 (16 and 17 Geo.5 Ch.vi) permitted the construction of a crematorium and an associated chapel. This was constructed in 1928 and was one of the earlier crematoriums in the country.<br />
The cemetery was sold in the 1960s and again in the 1970s, and maintenance of the cemetery was not kept up. The cemetery and its management company was acquired by Mr. Tony Towner, a barrister, in 1987. Despite the change in ownership the level of investment in maintenance continued to be inadequate. The Company operated the cemetery until 31 March 1998 when it closed the site. The closure decision caused local people, through the Association for the Preservation of Arnos Vale Cemetery (which became the Friends of Arno's Vale Cemetery in 1998), to take direct action in order to maintain access to the cemetery. On Thursday 21 May 1998 the MP for the Bristol East constituency, Ms Jean Corston, secured an adjournment debate on the subject of the cemetery and in July 1988 a march and demonstration through Bristol City Centre was organised by the Friends of Arno's Vale. Bristol City Council resolved to acquire the cemetery in June 2000. A charitable trust, the Arno's Vale Cemetery Preservation Trust, was established by the Friends of Arno's Vale. The cemetery was subject to compulsory purchase by Bristol City Council in early August 2003 and was immediately leased to the Arno's Vale Cemetery Preservation Trust (Cloke & Jones 2004) for a period of 125 years. Funding of £4.82 million was granted to the Trust by the Heritage Lottery Fund in mid-December 2005 to support a long-term conservation programme.<br />
The entrance gates, lodges, chapels, war memorial (SMR 20119) and several of the individual monuments are Listed Buildings, notably the tomb of the Indian reformer Raja Ram Mohun Roy Bahadoor (SMR 20120) which has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building No.901-1/47/438). The early Victorian landscaped element of the cemetery is included in the English Heritage Register of Gardens of Historic Interest (Grade II).
