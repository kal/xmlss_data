								The Theatre Royal, located on the north side of King Street. Interest in establishing a new theatre in Bristol emerged in 1764 and a group of 34 individuals including councillors and business people (notably Henry Cruger, George Daubney, Joseph Harford, Richard Champion and William Champion) each took a £50 share (Barker 1974, 6-7) and a further ten subscribers were admitted to the group on 30 May 1766 (BRO 8976 (15)). An executive committee was formed and a plot of land on the north side King Street and two houses on Rackhay to the east were purchased. One of these was demolished to provide a side access to the theatre. The committee was heavily influenced by the design of Wren's Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, London and commissioned James Saunderson, carpenter at the Drury Lane who had designed a theatre then being built at Richmond, to produce plans (Barker 1974, 8). The architect Thomas Paty was appointed to supervise the construction work (Priest 2003, 68). The foundation stone was laid on 30 November 1764 and the building appears to have been finished in the spring of 1766.<br />
The theatre was named the New Theatre and opened on 30 May 1766 with a performance of Sir Richard Steele's play "The Conscious Lovers" by the contracted company led by William Powell. As constructed, the main body of the theatre was a rectangular structure of stone rubble with a hipped roof some 20 metres to the north of King Street and the main entrance appears to have been off King Street, through the seventeenth-century house, No.38 King Street (BUAD 232M). Attached to the front of this building was a square portico extending over the footway of King Street and supported at its south-west and south-east corners by Roman Doric columns. At the centre of the south side was a pediment. Internally it had a raked stage with the stage machinery accommodated beneath. The auditorium had nine dress boxes and two circles. At the rear of the stage there were dressing rooms, two at each corner (one above the other), while there were two further dressing rooms at the north end of the basement. The space above the auditorium was used as the scenery workshop, the scenery flats being changed using wooden rails or grooves (Southern in Booth 1975, 69-79; Cooke 2002). The Green Room was sited in an element projecting east into Rackhay. The interior decoration was by Michael Edkins, known as a Bristol ceramic artist. Little is known of the Edkins decorative scheme although "carving, painting and gilding, executed with much taste" was used throughout. There was a frieze of triglyphs above the boxes. The partitions between the boxes were marked by pilasters and their fronts were apparently painted in green and gold (Barker 1974, 12). Internally the boxes were reported to have been papered with flock wallpaper and  The lighting throughout was from tallow candles. Barker estimated that the eighteenth-century theatre had a house of approximtely 1000, with around 320 seats in the Pit, over 250 in the Gallery, 267 seats in the dress circle and 148 in the upper circle (Barker 1974, 13).<br />
Edkins was employed to repaint parts of the interior in 1774 and in a lease of 1779 required the new lessee, John Palmer who also managed the Theatre Royal in Bath, to "make an entire alteration in the theatre, enlarge the lobby, [and] to build an elegant tea room and other accommodations." In 1788 a Royal licence was granted and the theatre was renamed the Theatre Royal. The theatre was the subject of another round of significant alteration around 1790 when the ceiling was raised and the whole interior redecorated and re-gilded. A new lease was granted in John Palmer in 1799 and Palmer undertook alterations which included the construction of the gallery and the associated sloping of the auditorium ceiling. At the same time the boxes were fitted in the Upper Circle. In 1820 William Edkins, Michael Edkins son, was commissioned by the lessee William M'Cready to redecorate the boxes. M'Cready had the proscenium arch rebuilt in March 1824 and then removed entirely in the autumn of 1826.<br />
In 1853 under a new lessee, J. H. Chute, the stage was enlarged by extending the building into the yard on its north side and new stage machinery was installed. Beneath the stage were two post traps, a grave trap or Hamlet trap, and bridges (lightweight timber frames which could be raised to stage level). Fixed to the roof trusses were a metal pulley wheels and winch for the safety curtain. The theatre was refurnished and redecorated as part of the project. Another substantial refurbishment was undertaken in 1881 in accordance with plans by C. J. Phipps and T. Pope and this saw the reduction of the size of the stage by five feet [1.53 metres], the addition of new stage traps and the alteration of the proscenium arch. Another scheme of redecoration was also implemented and the present ceiling of the auditorium, much of the extant plasterwork on the cornices of the pillars and the fronts of the boxes survives from this work.<br />
By 1891 the buildings which formed the entrance to the theatre had become structurally unstable and were demolished in 1903 to enable construction of a new entrance. This was designed by W. Skinner and was a two-storey, four-bay structure of brick. At ground-floor the western three bays formed an arcade of segmental-headed arches, the two western bays forming entrance doors for patrons. The eastern bay was a double-width entrance or haulingway. A glass pentice roof protected the public entrance from the elements and the fenestration at first-floor level comprised sash windows with segmental pediments. Over these was a string course and overhanging cornice with a parapet above.<br />
By the early 1940s the theatre was suffering serious financial decline and a public campaign was launched to establish a trust and purchase the building. This was successful and a series of renovations were made under the direction of the architect J. Ralph Edwards. The theatre reopened on 11 May 1943 (Barker 1974, 204-205).<br />
The theatre was subject to major alteration in 1970 in a scheme by the architect Peter Moro. The 1903 entrance was demolished and the next door Coopers' Hall (BUAD 16M), gutting the building, was incorporated into the theatre. Despite the status of the building as a Scheduled Ancient Monument the original stage was rebuilt and the Georgian dressing rooms at the back of the stage were demolished. A modernist studio theatre, designed by the project architect Michael Heard, was constructed at the western end of the site and a new foyer and first floor gallery were inserted into the Coopers' Hall. The basement was also lowered.<br />
There have been major architectural surveys of the building, made in 1942 by J. Ralph Edwards (BUAD 919) and in 1969 by the Ministry of Works (BUAD 4112). The latter includes an extensive photographic survey of the 1850s stage equipment. The theatre is a rare survival of a Georgian town theatre and is the earliest with any surviving interior in the United Kingdom. It is also thought to be the oldest theatre in the country to have been in continuous theatrical use.<br />
The building has a Grade I listing (Listed Building number 901-1/16/624).
