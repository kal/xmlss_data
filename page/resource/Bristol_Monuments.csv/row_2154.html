								The Cyder House, located 43 metres north-east of Broad Street. The building was constructed in the twelfth-century and was house with first floor hall. It was orientated from north-west to south-east (parallel to Broad Street) and the footprint of the building measured 13.3 metres from north-west to south-east and it was 7.1 metres wide. The building was constructed of Brandon Hill Grit and the walls were 1 metre thick at foundation level.<br />
<br />
At lower level there was a V-shaped window embrasure in the end wall.<br />
<br />
The foundations and end walls were constructed of Brandon Hill Grit, and exceeded 1 metre in thickness.<br />
<br />
It appears that the south-west side wall had been rebuilt later in the medieval period.<br />
<br />
A view of the exterior from the north-east was drawn by O'Neill in 1820 (BRSMG M2375) shows Cyder House Passage running below the first-floor hall, with, above the passage, a 2-light window with cinquefoil heads under an overall square head with drip moulding, the bottom of the window blocked off. To the north of the passage, against the north-west end of the Norman building, lay a later structure, perhaps of seventeenth-century date. It comprised 2 storeys and attic, 1 gable to each external elevation, its north-west end built against the rear of the Court House in Tailors Court. Both elevations jettied. Entrance, with porch, in north-east wall at first-floor, cross-window to left of it 3-light window in gable; small window to attic storey at right-hand end. South-east elevation not clearly illustrated, but probably with first-floor cross-window, and 3-light window to gable. Structure leading to porch not drawn in detail, but arch shown below it. Some detail of the rear and end of Court House.<br />
<br />
Recorded internally by Rowbotham in 1828, with a view apparently towards the north-western end of the first-floor room or hall. This was open to the roof, one of at least 4, or possibly 5, bays; arch-braced trusses springing off corbels about two-thirds of the way up the side wall, the two corbels visible decorated with faces. Two tiers of plain windbraces; long, moulded, purlin or similar, above uppermost tier. Between 2nd. & 3rd. bays from south, as drawn, a partition to wall plate height, with a full-width carved beam above doorway height; 2 adjacent doorways, left to stairs down, right to stairs up. In first bay of north-east wall, window of at least 2 lights, cinquefoil heads, bottom of lights blocked. in next bay, a small square window above corbels. Floorboards running along length of building; to left, bottom of staircase with twisted newels at bottom.<br />
<br />
Later, the building was in use as a tavern. It appears to have been the Lord Raglan tavern, gutted by fire in the early hours of Tuesday 4 January 1859. The Bristol Mercury newspaper for 8 January 1859 reported "At about a quarter past three o'clock on Tuesday morning a fire was discovered to have broken out in the Lord Raglan tavern, Cider-house passage, Broad-street." and that "The building being very old, and composed for the most part of wood, the fire spread with rapidity, and the part of the house used as a singing-room, and known as the Lord Raglan Concert-hall, together with the brew-house underneath, was soon wrapped in flames..." Such concert halls or rooms were the forerunners of the music hall.<br />
<br />
The south-east gable end remained intact, as did part of the south-west wall until 1990. The house was demolished in early 1990. The north-west gable end survives incorporated into the rear wall of the late-seventeenth century Court House, and was drawn in about 1992. The V-shaped window embrasure at lower level has survived.
