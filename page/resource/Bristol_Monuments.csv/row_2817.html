								St. Philip's Mills, a hemp and flax mill located between Stephen Street, Russ Street and Upper Cheese Lane (now New Kingsley Road). The mill was in extstence by the early 1870s (Winstone 1966, pls.62-63) and its form remained very similar until 1883 when the mill was surveyed for the Ordnance Survey first edition Town plan (Bristol Sheet LXXII.13.22). There were entrances to the site off Stephen Street and New Kingsley Road which led into an open metalled yard. On the north side of this yard, adjacent to the gateway on to New Kingsley Road, there was a two-storey stone rubble building with a hipped pantile roof. This had a steep flight of steps, apparently wooden, leading up to first-floor level. To the west of this was a detached square building and to the west again, a four storey building constructed of Pennant sandstone rubble, possibly a warehouse. This had at least nine bays and each bay contained small arched windows. Along the north side of the yard, on the south side of these buildings, there was a surface of large setts forming a vehicular route.<br />
On the south side of the yard was a single-storey L-shaped shed (at ST 59772 72932) measuring 55 metres from east to west and 22 metres wide. The main element of the shed was aligned roughly east-west and had at least fifteen bays while the shorter, north-south, arm of the building had only three bays. The northern wall of the building stood on the Stephen Street frontage of the site close to the gateway off Stephen Street. The building was constructed of coursed Pennant sandstone rubble and had a pitched clay tiled roof. Each bay contained a single large casement window with a flat relieving arch above the opening. In the yard immediately to the north of this building and parallel to it there were six rows of drying racks for the flax, each formed by timber posts standing approximately 1.5 metres high which were connected by horizontal rails 2-3 metres long. Attached to the eastern end of the L-shaped building, and slightly set back from it, was a taller three-bay building of three storeys with a pitched tiled roof. The side, north-west facing, elevation contained three arched casement windows at second-floor level.<br />
A rectangular building of two-storeys and attic stood on the New Kingsley Road frontage of the site (at ST 59812 72953), immediately to the north of these buildings and adjacent to the arched gateway opening on to New Kingsley Road. This measured 9.5 metres from east to west and 5.5 metres across and was constructed of rubble stone. The main, north-east facing, elevation was apparently of three bays, with sash windows at first floor. A dormer window with a pitched roof projected from the eaves at attic level and at either end of the roof there was a group of three tall chimney stacks. The side, north-west facing, wall was a single bay and has a projecting stone rubble porch with a flat roof at ground floor level. There was a single window, apparently with ashlar dressings, at first floor and another small window in the gable end. At the apex of the gable there was a bellcote. The functions of each of the buildings within the site is not currently (26/02/2002) clear.<br />
Much of the yard had been developed for an extension to the northern side of the L-shaped building by the time of the Ordnance Survey second edition 1:2500 plan (Gloucestershire Sheet LXXII.13) published in 1903. The mill buildings and, it is reported (Winstone 1966, pl.62), some of the associated machinery survived into the late 1950s. The buildings were subsequently demolished and the site redeveloped, although part of the boundary wall to the site appears to survive and some of the fabric of the late nineteenth-century extension to the L-shaped shed seems to have been incorporated into the new warehouse on the site.
