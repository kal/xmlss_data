								Queen Square. The Bristol Corporation took the decision to develop an urban square on the marsh to the south of the city at the end of the seventeenth century. The ground surface was raised by dumping approximately 2.5 metres of material, mainly industrial waste (Insole 1999), and the first house was built by a Dr. Reade who apparently began construction in 1700. The leases issued by the Corporation were very specific about the materials to be used in the housing and in restricting the trades which could be carried on from them (Ison 1952, 142). Building was completed in 1732, the north-west corner of the square being the last to be completed, but the green space at the centre initially had no formal layout. It did however reuse the trees from the earlier ropewalks (which were removed after lobbying by residents in 1710) to provide shaded walks and Millerd's map of c.1715 shows railings set around it.<br />
The square was intended as an exclusive residence, appropriating to the city's middle class what had formerly been a place of recreation and assembly for all. To form a centrepiece the Corporation commissioned an equestrian statue of William III by Michael Rysbrack (BUAD 308M) which was erected in September 1736. To enhance this formal paths on north-south and east-west axes were created, dividing the square into quadrants which were crossed diagonally by gravel paths. The Mansion House and the Custom House were built on the north side of the square. Illustrations in the Braikenridge Collection, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery suggest that in the early nineteenth century the trees on the square were being actively managed.<br />
In October 1831 after the failure of the Reform Bill in the House of Lords the Square was the scne of rioting. This was highly destructive to the buildings of the Square. The Mansion House and Custom House were fired by the rioters and the fire spread to the adjoining dwellings, particularly on the north and west sides of the Square, which were gutted. Although the buildings were reconstructed in the following decade, the riots initiated a decline in the social status of the square; houses were divided into multiple tenancies and businesses took some over as premises.<br />
Between 1937 and 1941 the dual carriageway of the inner circuit road was driven through the square. The Rysbrack statue was rotated from its original position facing north to face north-west, aligned with the road. A number of air raid shelters were constructed in the square in the years immediately before the Second World War. The road was closed in 1990 as a preliminary to a scheme to restore the square. This restoration project, carried out between September 1999 and 5th July 2000 when the square re-opened to the public, included the removal of the road surface, reorientation of the Rysbrack statue to its original position and the insertion of gravel walks.<br />
Archaeological work in the square has focused on the buildings and several were surveyed by Dr Roger Leech and the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England. An archaeological evaluation (BUAD 3369) was carried out in November 1998 in the south-western corner of the square to inform the restoration project and an archaeological watching brief (BUAD 3515) was maintained during the groundworks associated with the project (Etheridge 2000; Williams 1999, 104). There are also several photographs of the square and its buildings in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Wells 1975: Winstone 1957; 1962; 1970; 1971; 1986).<br />
A number of the buildings surrounding the square have listed status, including the Mansion House, the nineteenth-century Custom House and the equestrian statue of King William III by Michael Rysbrack (Grade I).
