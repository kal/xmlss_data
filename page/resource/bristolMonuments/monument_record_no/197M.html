									Church of SS. Philip and Jacob (ie. St. James), located on the east side of Tower Hill. The church stands within a roughly square churchyard of approximately 4700 square metres on the south side of Jacob Street, and lay outside the area of the planned medieval suburb of Old Market. The church was first recorded in the late-twelfth century. The advowson belonged to Tewkesbury Abbey, which appears to have exercised its right to appoint through its cell St. James Priory (BUAD 1024M).<br />
The church was built of Pennant sandstone in a random rubble construction with limestone ashlar detailing. Its original plan was cruciform, and the south transept now forms the base of the tower. However, little fabric from the twelfth-century church has been identified although the font, with a square scalloped basin, is Norman.<br />
The church was extensively rebuilt in the early-thirteenth century and its plan altered, the tower being relocated at the south-east corner of the nave. The chancel, nave and the lower element of the tower are all extant components of this phase of construction (BUAD 84; Anon. 1862, 91).<br />
The church underwent major alteration in the mid-fifteenth century. A north chancel aisle with an arch-braced roof was added and the upper part of the tower was rebuilt, presumably adding stages and giving the tower four stages in all. The south and east chancel aisles were refenestrated with Perpendicular Gothic tracery windows, and the nave was also reworked in a Perpendicular style. A waggon roof, with bosses, supported on carved corbels was added. A chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas had been established by 1473 (Wadley 1886, 148), and John Kemys and Robert fforthey also endowed chantries.<br />
St. James priory was dissolved in January 1540 and the advowson of the rectory was acquired by Henry Brayne as part of his purchase of the St. James property in 1544. Kemy's Chantry and fforthey's chantry were dissolved in the late 1540s. Thomas Boode was then the incumbent of Kemy's chantry and Henrie Spendalle occupied fforthey's chantry (Maclean 1883-84, 235-236). As part of the liturgical reordering associated with the reformation, the stone altars and rood screen were removed. In February 1547 the parish had 514 parishioners (Maclean 1883-84, 235-236).<br />
A new pulpit and sounding board were added in 1631 and a small Baroque porch was also built on the north side of the nave in the seventeenth century. Several commemorative monuments also date to the seventeenth century, including a large wall monument to Henry Merrett (d.1692). <br />
The Bristol Corporation had acquired the advowson of the parish by the early eighteenth century and the Rector of Winterbourne, Mr. William Cary, was vicar with Thomas Jones serving as curate. The parish was reported to have 263 houses in 1712, and 330 in 1735 (McGrath 1985, 45-46).<br />
Thomas Bilbie of Chew Stoke, who later established a bell foundry at Cullompton in Devon, cast a new tenor bell weighing approximately 18 cwt 2 lb 0 oz in 1739.<br />
Drawings of the interior of the church made by James Stewart in April 1748 indicate that there was then a gallery in the north aisle. The high altar was enclosed by a Baroque altar rail with spiral balusters and behind there was a late seventeenth or early eighteenth century reredos with Tuscan columns with Corinthian capitals. The ring was increased to eight bells in 1789.<br />
By 1759 Carew Reynell was vicar by 1759, with Thomas Chapman as his curate, and was probably the initiator of alterations made to the nave in 1764. Reynell resigned when he  succeeded to the curacy of St. James and  James New became vicar in April 1772.<br />
By 1822 William Day was vicar and was assisted by his son. Further alteration to the fabric took place in 1836. Projecting nave wings were built to house staircases to the galleries, new porches were built on the north side of the church and there was some refenestration. The church was restored in 1850 by the architect William Armstrong, of Brunswick Square, whose staff included E. W. Godwin. Godwin noted that the tower was then in a "neglected and damaged" state and was in use as "a place of deposit for lumber" (Anon. 1862, 91). The galleries were removed in 1876. The reredos was also replaced in the nineteenth-century.<br />
In 1907 works were undertaken to allow the north aisle to be used for worship. This entailed the movement of the remaining fragment of a medieval stone effigy of a recumbent knight in armour in the Kemys, or chapel, aisle, from the eastern end of the south side to a site within the most easterly panelled arch on the same side (Pritchard 1907, 223-224). In 1914 The 1739 Bilbie tenor bell was used to provide metal for a new bell (weighing 19 cwt  0 lb 11 oz) cast by Llewellin and James of Castle Green. <br />
Later in the twentieth century a single-storey extension was added to the south-east corner of the church.<br />
The church has a Grade II* listing (Listed Building number 901-1/40/298).
